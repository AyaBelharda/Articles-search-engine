In practice\nthis translates into a set of \u201cdimensions\u201d, each containing\nwell de\ufb01ned choices (or so called \u201cdimension elements\u201d) that\ncan be used to select individuals views.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the main advantage of making the\nartifacts used to describe a software system views of a SUM\nis that the number of pairwise coherence relationships that\nhave to be maintained is reduced and new views can be in-\ntroduced by simply de\ufb01ning their relationship to the SUM.\nMoreover, the importance of this advantage grows quickly\nas the size of the system and the complexity of the deployed\ndevelopment methodology increase. Another important ad-\nvantage is that the dominance of one particular kind of view\nover the development process (e.g. code) at the expense of\nother kinds of views (e.g. graphical models) is reduced so\nthat any appropriate type of views can be used to enrich\nthe underlying description of the system, depending on the\nneeds and skills of the stakeholder involved. This makes it\npossible to subsume all view types under the same, overarch-\nSUM\nSUM / View Centric Environment\nArtifact / Tools Centric Environment\nFigure 2: Consistency Dependencies in Artifact-oriented versus View-oriented Environments.\ning development process and methodology (e.g. agile-driven,\nfocusing on small development cycles, or model-driven de-\nvelopment, based on transformations between abstraction\nlevels). Although the details of how the views are created\nfrom the SUM and how the SUM is updated from the views\nare not central to the approach, a natural implementation\nis to use the visualization and transformation technologies\no\ufb00ered by model driven software engineering (MDSE).\nTo explore the validity of these hypotheses at the Uni-\nversity of Mannheim we have been developing a prototype\nOSM modeling environment based on an enhanced version\nof the KobrA method for model-driven, component-oriented\ndevelopment, KobrA 2.0 [1]. This was chosen as a basis for\nthe prototype, known as the Open, Adaptable, Orthographic\nModeling Environment (nAOMi) [13] because its views were\ndesigned with the precise goals of being (a) genuine pro-\njections of a subject containing carefully selected subsets\nof information about that subject, (b) minimalistic in the\nsense that they should overlap to the smallest extent possible\nand contain the minimum necessary models elements, and\n(c) selectable via a set of independent \u201cdimensions\u201d which\nre\ufb02ect di\ufb00erent fundamental concerns of development (i.e.\nabstraction levels, composition or variants). In other words,\nKobrA already provided one of the \u201cmost orthogonal\u201d sets\nof views for visualizing software systems of any contempo-\nrary method. More details about the actual views and di-\nmensions de\ufb01ned in KobrA are presented in the following\nsections. More information on OSM can be found in [2] and\n[3].\nnAOMi is implemented as an Eclipse plugin using the\nEclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) as the underlying mod-\neling platform and UML 2.0 tools [4] to generate and edit\nviews.\nThe KobrA 2.0 metamodel on which the current\nversion of nAOMi is based is a specialization of the UML\nmetamodel composed of three separate packages \u2014 one for\nthe SUM, one for the views and one for the transformations\n(Figure 3). The UML was chosen as the base language be-\ncause of its maturity and widespread acceptance, making the\nenvironment usable to the largest possible body of develop-\ners. UML elements not needed in KobrA 2.0 are excluded\nusing OCL constraints while new elements or properties are\nKobrA2\nTransformation\nSUM\nViews\nFigure 3: KobrA 2.0 Top Level Packages.\nintroduced by specializing existing elements.\nThe unique contribution of this paper is to elaborate on\nthe structure of the KobrA 2.0 metamodel and how it is used\nto drive nAOMi. The three following sections each focus on\none of the three main components of the metamodel \u2014 the\nSUM, the views and the transformations . This is followed\nby a brief overview of the OSM navigation paradigm in Sec-\ntion 5 before a small example of the approach is presented in\nSection 6. Section 7 then concludes the paper with related\nand future work.\n2.\nSUM PACKAGE\nFigure 4 depicts the internal structure of the SUM pack-\nage which is based on the UML metamodel. There are three\nmain subpackages, two containing the structural and behav-\nioral constructs respectively, and one containing the con-\nstraints that ensure that the metaclasses are used according\nto the KobrA conventions and rules.\nThe Classes subpackage of the Structure package contains\nsome of the most fundamental elements of the KobrA meta-\nmodel, such as Class and ComponentClass.\nThe internal\nstructure of this package is illustrated in Figure 5. Com-\nponentClass represents objects with complex and reusable\nbehaviors, while Class captures simple \u201cdata type\u201d objects\nthat have only very simple or non-reusable behaviors. The\nmodeler has to decide whether it is necessary to model a\nspeci\ufb01c part of the system as a ComponentClass and include\nstate charts and activity diagrams, or whether it is su\ufb03cient\nto use a Class (which is limited to using OCL constraints).\nComponentClass inherits (indirectly via Class) from Com-\nmunications so it also has the isActive attribute. This makes\nKobrA2::SUM::Constraint::Behavioral\nKobrA2::SUM::Constraint::Structural\nKobrA2::SUM::Constraint\nKobrA2::SUM::Constraint::Common\nKobrA2::SUM::Behavior::ProtocolStateMachines\nKobrA2::SUM::Behavior::Common\nKobrA2::SUM::Behavior::Activities\nKobrA2::SUM::Behavior::Actions\nKobrA2::SUM::Behavior\nKobrA2::SUM::Structure::Classes\nKobrA2::SUM::Structure::Types\nKobrA2::SUM::Structure::Instances\nKobrA2::SUM::Structure::Elements\nKobrA2::SUM::Structure\nKobrA2::SUM::Constraint::OclExpressions\n<<merge>>\n<<merge>>\n<<merge>>\n<<merge>>\n<<merge>>\n<<merge>>\n<<merge>>\n<<merge>>\n<<merge>>\n<<merge>>\n<<merge>>\n<<merge>>\nFigure 4: KobrA 2.0 SUM Package.\nit possible to model whether its instances are active or pas-\nsive. Active objects, which can be used to model threads and\nprocesses ([8] p. 438), start to execute their behavior as soon\nas they are created and perform operations spontaneously.\nA ComponentClass may exhibit complex behavior. In Ko-\nbrA, this behavior may be speci\ufb01ed in the form of\nUML\nState Diagrams (de\ufb01ning acceptable operation invocation\nsequences), and in the form of Activities (de\ufb01ning algorithms\nof operations). UML Interaction elements (in sequence dia-\ngrams) can be derived from the activity elements and thus\nare not included in the SUM. As KobrA aims to facilitate\nautomatic checking of allowed sequences of operation calls,\nProtocol State Machines are supported instead of general\nstate machines. Since the latter include a large variety of\nelements not needed for specifying acceptable operation se-\nquences or automatic checking, OCL constraints are used to\nprohibit the use of unwanted features.\ncontext\nComponentClass\n-- only\nallow\nActivity\nelements\nor\nProtocolStateMachines\ninv: ownedBehavior ->forAll( oclIsKindOf( Actitivity) or\noclIsKindOf ( ProtocolStateMachine ))\nFor example, since KobrA has no concept of roles for com-\nponents, the use of role also needs to be prohibited. The part\nassociation refers to owned properties of components whose\nattribute isComposite is true. As KobrA uses associations\nlike nests and creates for components, part, required and\nprovided are not needed. Connectors (i.e. delegation and\nassembly) are not used in KobrA either so ownedConnector\nis excluded.\nClass\nKobrA2::SUM::Structure::Classes\nGeneralizationSet\nAssociationClass\nComponentClass\nProperty\nUsage\nAssociation\nOperation\nPackageable\nElement\nParameter\nAcquires\nCreates\nNests\nUML::Component::PackagingComponents::Component\nUML::CommonBehaviors::Communications::Class\n+ownedOperation\n*\n+class\n0..1\n+supplier\n1..*\n{subsets supplierDependency}\n+supplierUsage\n*\n+client\n1..*\n{subsets clientDependency}\n+clientUsage\n*\n+ownedAttribute\n*\n+class\n0..1\n+powertype\n0..1\n+powertypeExtent\n*\n+packagedElement\n*\n{subsets component}\n+componentClass\n0..1\n+/superClass\nFigure 5: KobrA 2.0 Classes Package.\ncontext\nComponentClass\ninv: role ->union(part)->union( ownedConnector )\n->union( collaborationUse )-> union( representation )\n->union( realization)->union(required)\n->union(provided)->isEmpty ()\n3.\nVIEWS PACKAGE\nThe structure of the Views package is illustrated in Figure\n6. Again, since most of the views de\ufb01ned in KobrA 2.0 are\nbased on UML diagrams, the view metamodels have similar\nelements to the SUM metamodel. The big di\ufb00erence to the\nSUM is that there are no restrictions on the use of the view\nmetamodel elements.\nFor instance, views for a particular\npurpose such as supporting model checkers can be supported\nby adding elements unrelated to the UML.\nThe substructure of the Views package re\ufb02ects the types\nand organization of the KobrA views according to the view\n\u201cdimensions\u201d supported in nAOMi (cf. example in Section\n6). At the top level, the Views package is thus decomposed\ninto the Speci\ufb01cation and Realization options of the encap-\nsulation dimension.\nThese, in turn are both decomposed\ninto the Structural, Behavioral and Operational options of\nthe Projection dimension.\nFinally, with the exception of\nthe behavioral option, these are also all subdivided into the\nService and Type options of the granularity dimension. This\ndimension, with its two options, is an addition to the original\nversion of KobrA.\nThe Service view shows the direct, publicly visible rela-\ntionships of the subject ComponentClass to other Compo-\nnentClasses, while the Type view shows the publicly visi-\nble relationships of the subject to simple Classes. As with\nthe SUM, constraints have been de\ufb01ned to control what can\ngo into each view and when they are well formed. For ev-\nery view, a constraint enumerates all allowed elements (not\nshown in this paper).\nIn the following, some of the other constraints for the\nService view are elaborated. Since this view is a black-box\nview, the internals of ComponentClasses (nestedClassi\ufb01er)\nare not shown.\ncontext\nComponentClass\n-- no nested\nclassifiers , no\nprotocol\ninv: nestedClassifier ->union(protocol)->isEmpty ()\nClasses are only allowed if they are generalizations of Com-\nponentClasses, (or any of its superclasses, since a Compo-\nnentClass may inherit from a class as shown in the con-\nstraints with context Class.

Part of the package\u2019s contents are shown\nin Figure 7.\nThe Abstraction concept (which is in fact a\nKobrA2::Transformation::Common::AllViews\nAbstraction\nTransformationExpression\nViewElement\nSumElement\nView\nKobrA2::SUM::Structure::Elements::Element\nKobrA2::Views::ConcreteSyntax::Element\nKobrA2::SUM::Constraint::Behavioral::Exp\nressionInOcl\nKobrA2::Views::Subject::View\n{subsets mapping}\n0..1\n0..1\n{subsets clientDependency}\n+abstraction 1\n{subsets client}\n+ve 1\n1..*\n1\n{subsets supplier}\n+se 1\n{subsets supplierDependency}\n+abstraction 1..*\nFigure 7: Transformation abstractions.\ndependency reused from the UML but with additional con-\nstraints) plays the key role in relating elements from the\nSUM to elements of a view. Abstraction is actually mapped\nto ExpressionInOcl.\nWhen appearing in transformations,\nthe equals sign links elements in the SUM to the respective\nelements in the view, and vice versa. For instance, equal-\nity of the general meta-association of a Generalization in\na transformation invariant means that, when following gen-\neral, there must be an element in the SUM and in the view\nfor which similar transformation expressions are speci\ufb01ed.\nIn the case of KobrA 2.0, which has many projections that\njust select a subset of elements using one-to-one abstrac-\ntions, this allows concise declarative TransformationExpres-\nsions. Together with the view constraints, a CASE tool can\nbe implemented which uses a transformation language of the\nimplementor\u2019s choice, for instance the Atlas Transformation\nLanguage (ATL) [11] or QVT [9]. The role names se and ve\nare short for SumElement and ViewElement, respectively.\nThese roles subset the client and supplier roles from the\nUML.\nSUM elements are translated into UML elements with\nstereotypes, so that the views are easy to manage for de-\nvelopers familiar with the UML. The bidirectional mappings\nbetween stereotyped view elements and non-stereotyped SUM\nelements are expressed in the constraints of the Association-\nAbstraction, a subclass of the Abstraction from the AllViews\npackage. This is also an example of a transformation which\nis reused in other views.\ncontext\nAssociationAbstraction\ninv: ve.memberEnd = se.memberEnd\ninv: ve.ownedEnd = se.ownedEnd\nivn: ve. navigableOwnedEnd = se. navigableOwnedEnd\ninv: se. oclIsKindOf(Acquires) implies ve.\nhasStereotype (\u2019acquires \u2019)\ninv: ve. hasStereotype (\u2019acquires \u2019)\nimplies\nse.\noclIsKindOf (Aquires)\ninv: se. oclIsKindOf(Nests) implies\nve. hasStereotype (\u2019\nnests \u2019)\ninv: ve. hasStereotype (\u2019nests \u2019)\nimplies se. oclIsKindOf\n(Nests)\ninv: se. oclIsKindOf (Creates) implies\nve. hasStereotype\n(\u2019creates \u2019)\ninv: ve. hasStereotype (\u2019creates \u2019)\nimplies se.\noclIsKindOf (Creates)\nFigure 8 shows the main elements involved in the trans-\nformation of the black box structural view for Component-\nClasses. The \ufb01rst transformation constraint is on the view\nand declares the starting point for the transformation. It\nstates that the subject ComponentClass and its generaliza-\ntions (using a SUM utility function, superClosure) are in the\nview.\nThe following transformation rules illustrate how to create\nthe output (i.e. view) elements from the input (i.e. SUM) el-\nements, such as the publicly visible attributes and operations\nof the ComponentClass and the acquired ComponentClasses.\nThe \ufb01rst constraint for ComponentClassAbstraction states\nthat references to potential general classes (and Component-\nClasses) of ComponentClasses are mirrored in the view. In\naddition, ComponentClasses will be shown with the corre-\nsponding stereotypes.\nThe ComponentClass owns various\ntypes of associations, so in this view only the acquires asso-\nciations are selected (whose transformation rules are cov-\nered in the common transformation packages).For classes\nand ComponentClasses, only publicly visible attributes and\noperations appear in the view.\nClass invariants are also\ncopied. Classes that may appear in this view (e.g. as gener-\nalizations of ComponentClasses) may have a powertype (role\nname powertypeExtent) which will be displayed.\nThe last transformation statement copies the class refer-\nences of operations. As with all views, the transformation\nrules, the common transformation statements (which also\ncover operations) and the view constraints serve as a speci-\n\ufb01cation for the implementation of a view. Individual CASE\ntools can use di\ufb00erent implementation techniques as long as\nthey conform to the semantics of these rules and constraints.\nKobrA2::Transformation::Specification::Structural::Class::Service\nComponentClassAbstraction\nKobrA2::Transformation::Common::Feature::OperationAbstraction\nKobrA2::Transformation::Common::AllViews::Abstraction\nKobrA2::SUM::Structure::Classes::ComponentClass\nKobrA2::SUM::Structure::Classes::Operation\nKobrA2::SUM::Structure::Classes::Class\nOperationAbstraction\nClassAbstraction\n+se\n1\n1..*\n+se\n1\n1..*\n+se\n1\n1..*\nFigure 8: Transformation to the Speci\ufb01cation Structural Service View.\ncontext\nKobrA2 :: Views :: Subject ::\nSpecificationStructuralClassService\ninv: ownedMember ->select( oclIsKindOf(Class)) =\nsubject.superClosure ->union(subject.acquires.\nsuperClosure )\ncontext\nComponentClassAbstraction\ninv: ve.superClass = se. superClass\ninv: ve. hasStereotype (\u2019ComponentClass \u2019)\ninv: se.isSubject\nimplies (ve. hasStereotype (\u2019subject\n\u2019) and ve.ownedMember ->select( oclIsKindOf (\nAssociation )) = se.ownedMember ->select(\noclIsKindOf (Acquires)))\ncontext\nClassAbstraction\ninv: ve. ownedAttribute = se.ownedAttribute ->select(\nvisibility =# public)\ninv: ve. ownedOperation = se.ownedOperation ->select(\nvisibility =# public)\ninv: ve.\u2018inv \u2019 = se.\u2018inv \u2019\n-- copy\npowertypeExtent\nthat is only\nallowed\nfor\nclass\ninv: ve. powertypeExtent = se. powertypeExtent\ncontext\nOperationAbstraction\ninv: ve.class = se.class\nFor the black box type view, only publicly visible at-\ntributes and operations of classes (as opposed to Compo-\nnentClasses) used by the subject can be seen.

In an any envi-\nronment incorporating a number of di\ufb00erent tools there is\ninvariably a large number of di\ufb00erent trees storing a het-\nerogeneous mix of artifacts including model elements (e.g.\nclasses, instances, associations), diagrams (e.g.\nclass dia-\ngrams, state diagrams) and other artifact types (source code,\nXML \ufb01les, con\ufb01guration \ufb01les ). To work with all the views in\na traditional development environment, therefore, engineers\ntypically have to learn about the organization structures of\nall the incorporated tools.\nIn contrast to conventional paradigms for organizing and\nnavigating the many views used to visualize a system, OSM\nemploys the metaphor of a multi-dimensional cube. More\nspeci\ufb01cally, as illustrated in Figure 9, OSM regards dimen-\nsion of the underlying methodology as representing a di\ufb00er-\nent dimension of the cube, and each independently variable\naspect of that dimension is a selectable dimension element.\nSelecting a view thus simply corresponds to selecting a single\ncell within the cube. In general, three types of dimensions\nare supported: static dimensions in which the number of\nFigure 9: Dimension-based navigation.\nselectable elements (i.e. coordinates) is \ufb01xed, dynamic di-\nmensions in which the number of elements is dynamic (i.e.\nderived from the SUM), and mixed dimensions which have\nboth static and dynamic elements.\nTo support the OSM dimension based navigation metaphor\nfor KobrA, we de\ufb01ned the seven dimensions indicated on the\nleft hand side of Figure 10 which is a sceenshot of nAOMI.\nThe Abstraction dimension (not expanded here), which has\nthree static dimension elements, PIM (platform independent\nmodel), PSM (platform speci\ufb01c model) and Code, captures\nthe model-driven development concern of KobrA. The ver-\nsion dimension captures the state of the modeled system at\nspeci\ufb01c points in time. The Component dimension, which\nhas dynamic dimension elements de\ufb01ned by instances of the\nclass ComponentClass in the SUM, captures the component-\nbased development concern of KobrA.\nThe Encapsulation dimension, which has two \ufb01xed ele-\nments, supports the distinction between Speci\ufb01cation (black\nbox) and Realization (white box) views of components, while\nthe Projection dimension with the \ufb01xed elements Structural,\nOperational and Behavioral covers the di\ufb00erent information\ntypes. The Granularity dimension provides a \ufb01ner grained\ndistinction between views describing the types used by com-\nponents (Type granularity) and views describing the required\nand provided interfaces (Service granularity). The Opera-\ntion dimension allows a selection of individual operations.\nIn the ideal case, when all views are truly orthogonal, the\nchoices that can be made in each dimensions are completely\nindependent.\nHowever, this is very di\ufb03cult to achieve in\nsoftware engineering. The approach still works if the views\nare not completely orthogonal, but dependencies then occur\nbetween di\ufb00erent choices in di\ufb00erent dimensions, so that the\ndecisions made in one dimensions may a\ufb00ect choices possi-\nble in another dimension. This is best handled by giving\ndimensions a precedence ranking determined by the order\nin which they appear (the top being the highest). When an\nelement in a dimension is selected, the tool automatically\nmakes default selections for dimensions of lower precedence\n(i.e.\ndimensions lower down) and disables selections that\nwould navigate to cells (i.e. views) which are not (yet) de-\n\ufb01ned by the method at hand.\n6.\nSHOPPING CART EXAMPLE\nTo show how a software system can be speci\ufb01ed using\nnAOMi, this section presents a case study based on a shop-\nping cart system. A ShoppingCart component collects and\nFigure 10: Speci\ufb01cation Structural View.\nmanages the products selected by users and supports pay-\nment via a credit card.\nFigure 10 illustrates a structural\nview of the component.\nIn the dimension navigator on the left hand side, PIM\nwas chosen for the \u201cAbstraction Level\u201d (not expanded in the\nscreenshot). The second dimension is the state of the soft-\nware system at a certain point in time. The picture shows\nthat the latest available version was chosen. As with every\nchoice in a dimension, it may in\ufb02uence the options in lower\nranked dimensions. The component under consideration is\nthe ShoppingCart, for which a black box view is selected\nin the next dimension. After the user selects the structural\nprojection option and the service level granularity, the tool\nautomatically chooses the option for all operations in the\nlast dimension, as there is no editor registered for the other\noptions.\nThe component under development is presented with the\nstereotype subject and its relationship to other components\nand classes is shown in the view, which corresponds to a cell\nof the multi-dimensional navigation cube, and is generated\non-the-\ufb02y from the SUM when it is selected. The classes\nProduct and CreditCard can be used as data types in the\noperations of the component.\nFigure 11 illustrates the operational view in which an\noperation can be formalized using pre- and postconditions.\nThe precondition corresponds to the assumes clause in and\nthe postcondition corresponds to the result clause. As in the\nUML, the precondition of an operation must be true when\nthe operation is invoked and the postcondition must be true\nwhen the operation is \ufb01nished. The operation addProduct\nin Figure 11 must be in state CollectingProducts or Empty\nwhen invoked. This is also visible in the behavioral view,\nFigure 11: addProduct() Operation Speci\ufb01cation.\nsince there are only two transitions with the operation ad-\ndProduct. Both leads to the state CollectingProducts which\nis also a postcondition of the operation. The second post-\ncondition is that the cost attribute of the component must\nbe increased by the price of the added product. The pre- and\npostcondition can be expressed using the OCL. The proper-\nties of the component, states and operation parameters can\nbe used to formalise the constraints like as in this example.\nFigure 12 shows the publicly visible behaviour of the Shop-\npingCart component with states and transitions. The condi-\ntional transitions map to operations of the component. Like\nevery view, this view is also synchronized with the SUM so\nthat it is guaranteed that its operations, states and proper-\nties are consistent with those in the structural view.\nFigure 12: Speci\ufb01cation Behavioral Model.\nAlthough the operational view seems to be similar to the\nbehavioral view because of the overlapping information within\nthem, there are signi\ufb01cant di\ufb00erences. The focus of the op-\nerational view is on a precise formal de\ufb01nition of an opera-\ntion of a component. The operations can be enriched by pre-\nand postconditions which can be de\ufb01ned using complex OCL\nstatements, that formalize the complete behavior of an op-\neration. The additional information in the OCL statements\ncan be used for code generation and documentation.\n7.\nCONCLUSION\nAt the beginning of the paper we identi\ufb01ed three funda-\nmental hypothesis upon which the notion of OSM is based\n\u2014 (a) that it is feasible to integrate the many di\ufb00erent kinds\nof artifacts used in contemporary software engineering meth-\nods within a single coherent methodology in which they are\ntreated as views, (b) that it is feasible to create an e\ufb03-\ncient and scalable way of supporting these views by gener-\nating them dynamically, on-the-\ufb02y, from a Single Underly-\ning Model (SUM) using model-based transformations and\n(c) that it is feasible to provide an intuitive metaphor for\nnavigating around these many views by adapting the ortho-\ngraphic projection technique underpinning the CAD tools\nused in other engineering disciplines.\nThe prototype tool, nAOMi, described in this paper rep-\nresents the \ufb01rst step towards demonstrating the validity of\nthese hypotheses and showing that OSM is a viable approach\nto software engineering. Of the three hypotheses, (a) and (c)\nare most convincingly demonstrated by the prototype, since\nit shows that it is indeed possible to support all the views\nof the KobrA method within a single navigation metaphor.\nThe prototype tool does not demonstrate the validity of hy-\npothesis (b) to the same extent as the others due to its\nsmall size. Although it demonstrates the feasibility of gen-\nerating views from the SUM and vice-versa, the question of\nwhether such an approach scales up to large environments\nis still open.\nAlthough nOAMi is the only tool developed with the spe-\nci\ufb01c aim of supporting KobrA-based OSM, several other\ntools and methods have similar properties or aims.\nFor\nexample, Glinz et al.\n[10] describe a tool with a \ufb01sheye\nzooming algorithm which lets the user view a model with\nvarying amounts of detail depending on the context. It has\nto be investigated whether it is possible to combine the \ufb01sh-\neye zooming concept with the dimension-based navigation\nparadigm. While the KobrA 2.0 implementation of nAOMi\nheavily uses UML diagrams for developers, Glinz et al. use\ncustom diagram types, e.g.\nfor structural and behavioral\nviews.\nAn approach which also emphasizes the description of for-\nmal consistency rules (correspondences) between views is\nRM-ODP [5][6].\nHowever, this approach does not explic-\nitly mention the notion of a SUM and thus implies that\nconsistency rules should be de\ufb01ned in a pairwise fashion be-\ntween individual pairs of views. ArchiMate [7], which com-\nplements TOGAF [12], is an enterprise architecture mod-\neling language which o\ufb00ers two orthogonal \u201ddimensions\u201d for\nmodeling, (business, architecture, and technology) layers and\n(informational, behavioral and structural) aspects and also\nsuggests two more dimensions, purpose and abstraction level.\nHowever, as many of these views span multiple choices of a\nsingle\u201cdimension\u201d, the intuitive dimension-based navigation\nmetaphor of OSM can not be easily applied. There are also\nmore general approaches for view-based modeling but they\nare less speci\ufb01c in terms of consistency rules between views\nand provide little guidance on how to manage and navigate\nviews, for example the Zachman Framework [14].\nRegarding the practical use of OSM environments in the\nfuture, the biggest challenge is developing appropriate SUM\nmetamodels which can accommodate all the types of views\nand services that software engineers are accustomed to to-\nday. For this \ufb01rst prototypical SUM-based environment sup-\nporting the OSM approach we had a method at our disposal\n(KobrA) that already de\ufb01ned a full set of orthogonal UML-\nbased views. This allowed us to model the required SUM\nand view metamodels by simply adapting the UML meta-\nmodels, removing and adding model elements as needed.\nIn doing so we were able to manually ensure that the meta-\nmodels ful\ufb01lled the two core requirements of SUM-based en-\nvironments \u2014 (1) being minimalistic and (2) redundancy\nfree. If SUM-based software engineering environments are\nto take o\ufb00, and to be introduced into existing, heteroge-\nneous environments, more sophisticated ways of integrating\nexisting metamodels into a single uni\ufb01ed metamodel will be\nrequired.\n8.\nREFERENCES\n[1] C.

Introduction \nThe goal of this effort is to explore a model for design and \nimplementation of an AI agent for turn based games. This model \nprovides for building more capable computer opponents that rely \non strategies that closely resemble human approach in solving \nproblems opposed to classical computational centric heuristics in \ngame AI. In this manner the computational resources can be \nfocused on more sensible strategies for the game play.  \nWith the advancement in computer hardware increasingly \nmore computing power is left for executing AI algorithms in \ngames. In the past AI in games was mainly a cheating set of \ninstructions that simulated the increasing difficulty in the game \nenvironment so that the player had the illusion of real counterpart. \nImprovement in available memory and processing power allows \nimplementation of more intelligent algorithms for building the \ngame environment as well as direct interaction with the human \nplayers.   \nIn this particular research the emphasis is put on the \ninteraction between the AI agent and a computer player in the \nrealm of the game rules. It is particularly focused on turn based \ngames that have the elements of uncertainty like dice or concealed \ninformation. At the beginning a description of Game AI \nalgorithms are given; such as Game Trees and Minimax. The \nfollowing section describes an approach of using AI Planning to \nimprove building Game Trees in games with imperfect \ninformation where Game Trees tend to be very large with high \ngrowth ratio. Section 4 discusses another approach that provides a \nsignificant reduction to the number of considered moves in order \nto find the favorable strategy of the AI player. This approach uses \nAI Planning techniques and Case Base Reasoning (CBR) to plan \nfor different scenarios in predetermined strategies which would be \nanalogous to human player experience in the particular game. The \nCBR database illustrates a set of past experiences for the AI \nproblem and the AI Planning illustrates the procedure to deal with \nthe given situation in the game. In the next two sections \nimplementations and evaluations of both approaches are given. \nThe AI Planning approach is implemented with the Tic-tac-toe \ngame and the combined AI Planning and CBR approach is \nimplemented with a model for the Monopoly game. The last part \ncontains conclusions and future work ideas.  \n2. Game Trees and Minimax \nGame Trees are common model for evaluating how different \ncombinations of moves from the player and his opponents will \naffect the future position of the player and eventually the end \nresult of the game. An algorithm that decides on the next move by \nevaluating the results from the built Game Tree is minimax [1]. \nMinimax assumes that the player at hand will always choose the \nbest possible move for him, in other words the player will try to \nselect the move that maximizes the result of the evaluation \nfunction over the game state. So basically the player at hand needs \nto choose the best move overall while taking into account that the \nnext player(s) will try to do the same thing. Minimax tries to \nmaximize the minimum gain. Minimax can be applied to multiple \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that \ncopies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Furthermore, V is \nthe best payoff each can expect to receive from a play of the \ngame; that is, these mixed strategies are the optimal strategies for \nthe two players. \nThis theorem was established by John von Neumann, who is \nquoted as saying \"As far as I can see, there could be no theory of \ngames \u2026 without that theorem \u2026 I thought there was nothing \nworth publishing until the Minimax Theorem was proved\" [2]. \nA simple example of minimax can be observed by building a \ngame tree of the tic-tac-toe game. The tic-tac-toe game is a simple \ngame which can end by the first player wining, the second player \nwining or a tie. There are nine positions for each of the players in \nwhich at each turn the player puts X or O sign. If the player has \nthree adjacent signs in a row, column or the two diagonals he or \nshe wins. This game has limited number of position and it is well \nsuited for building the whole game tree. The leaves of this tree \nwill be final positions in the game. A heuristics evaluation \nfunction will also need to be written to evaluate the value of each \nnode along the way. \n3. AI Planning for building Game Trees \n3.1.1 AI Planning \nAI Planning also referred as Automated Planning and \nScheduling is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on \nfinding strategies or sequences of actions that reach a predefined \ngoal [3]. Typical execution of AI Planning algorithms is by \nintelligent agents, autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles. \nOpposed to classical control or classification AI Planning results \nwith complex solutions that are derived from multidimensional \nspace. \n AI Planning algorithms are also common in the video game \ndevelopment. They solve broad range of problems from path \nfinding to action planning. A typical planner takes three inputs: a \ndescription of the initial state of the world, a description of the \ndesired goal, and a set of possible actions. Some efforts for \nincorporating planning techniques for building game trees have \nalso shown up, similar to the approach explored in this effort. In \naddition Cased Based Reasoning [4] techniques are also gathering \npopularity in developing strategies based in prior knowledge \nabout the problems in the games. One of the benefits from \nHierarchical Task Network (HTN) [5] planning is the possibility \nto build Game Trees based on HTN plans; this method is \ndescribed in the following section. \n3.2 Game Trees with AI Planning \nAn adaptation of the HTN planning can be used to build \nmuch smaller and more efficient game trees. This idea has already \nbeen implemented in the Bridge Baron a computer program for \nthe game of Contact Bridge [6]. \nComputer programs based on Game Tree search techniques \nare now as good as or better than humans in many games like \nChess [7] and checkers [8], but there are some difficulties in \nbuilding a game tree for games that have imperfect information \nand added uncertainty like card or games with dice. The main \nproblem is the enormous number of possibilities that the player \ncan choose from in making his move. In addition some of the \nmoves are accompanied with probabilities based on the random \nelements in the games. The number of possible moves \nexponentially grows with each move so the depth of the search \nhas to be very limited to accommodate for the memory \nlimitations.  \nThe basic idea behind using HTN for building game trees is \nthat the HTN provides the means of expressing high level goals \nand describing strategies how to reach those goals. These goals \nmay be decomposed in goals at lower level called sub-goals. This \napproach closely resembles the way a human player usually \naddresses a complex problem. It is also good for domains where \nclassical search for solution is not feasible due to the vastness of \nthe problem domain or uncertainties. \n3.2.1 Hierarchical Task Networks \nThe Hierarchical Task Network, or HTN, is an approach to \nautomated planning in which the dependency among actions can \nbe given in the form of networks [9] [Figure 1]. \nA simple task network (or just a task network for short) is an \nacyclic digraph \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd in which U is the node set, E is the \nedge set, and each node \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd contains a task \ufffd\ufffd. The edges of \ufffd\ndefine a partial ordering of U. If the partial ordering is total, then \nwe say that \ufffd is totally ordered, in which case \ufffd can be written as \na sequence of tasks \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd.\nFigure 1: Simple Hierarchical Task Network \nA Simple Task Network (STN) method is a 4-tuple of its name, \ntask, precondition and a task network. The name of the method \nlets us refer unambiguously to substitution instances of the \nmethod, without having to write the preconditions and effects \nexplicitly. The task tells what kind of task can be applied if the \npreconditions are met. The preconditions specify the conditions \nthat the current state needs to satisfy in order for the method to be \napplied. And the network defines the specific subtasks to \naccomplish in order to accomplish the task. \nA method is relevant for a task if the current state satisfies the \npreconditions of a method that implements that task. This task can \nbe then substituted with the instance of the method. The \nsubstitution is basically giving the method network as a solution \nfor the task. \nIf there is a task \u201cGo home\u201d and the distance to home is 3km \n[Figure 2] and there exists a method walk-to and this method has a \nprecondition that the distance is less than 5km, then a substation \nto the task \u201cGo home\u201d can be made with this method instance.  \nFigure 2: HTN Method \nBuy milk\nGo to (shop)\nPurchase \nGo to (home)\nGo-to (from, to)\nWalk (to)\nIf (to \u2013 from) < 5km \n296\nDIMEA 2008\n3rd International Conference on Digital Interactive Media in Entertainment and Arts\nIf the distance is larger than 5km another meth\nto be substituted [Figure 3]. \nFigure 3: HTN Method 2 \nAn STN planning domain is a set of operatio\nmethods M.

How this is done, what part of the \nprocess that is focused, what type of problems that drives the \nmethods, etc. varies considerably, however\".  \nWhile the underlying ideas of CBR can be applied \nconsistently \nacross \napplication \ndomains, \nthe \nspecific \nimplementation of the CBR methods \u2013in particular retrieval and \nsimilarity functions\u2013 is highly customized to the application at \nhand. \n4.2 CBR and Games \nMany different implementations of CBR exist in games. \nCBR technology is nicely suited for recognizing complex \nsituations much easier and more elegant than traditional parameter \ncomparison or function evaluation. There are especially evident \ncases in real time strategies where different attack and defense of \nglobal strategies are nicely defined by CBR datasets and later used \nin the running games. Also intelligent bots behavior is also \nanother typical example. Depending on the number of enemy bots \nthe layout of the terrain and position of human players the CBR \nsystem finds the closest CBR case and employs that strategy \nagainst the human players which in prior evaluation was proved to \nbe highly efficient. \n5. Game Trees with AI Planning \u2013 Tic-tac-toe \nIn order to show the expressive power of AI Planning in \ndefining strategies for games, and the use of these plans to build \nGame Trees I implemented an algorithm that builds Game Trees \nfor the Tic-Tac-Toe game. \nThe game tree of Tic-Tac-Toe shows 255,168 possible \ngames of which 131,184 are won by X (the first player), 77904 \nare won by O and the rest 46,080 are draw [13]. All these games \ncan be derived from building a complete Game Tree.  \nEven though it is possible to build a complete game tree of \nTic-tac-toe it is definitely not an optimal solution. Many of the \nmoves in this tree would be symmetrical and also there are a many \nmoves that would be illogical or at least a bad strategy to even \nconsider.  \nSo what strategy should X (the first player) choose in order \nto win the game? \nThere are few positions that lead to certain victory. These \npositions involve simultaneous attack on two positions so the \nother player could not defend, basically the only trick in Tic-Tac-\nToe. \nFigure 6: Tic-tac-toe winning strategy positions \nPosition 1 leads to victory if the two of the three fields: top \nmiddle, bottom left corner and bottom right corner are free \n[Figure 6]. \nPosition 2 lead to victory if two of the three fields: top right \ncorner, bottom right corner and bottom middle are free [Figure ]. \nAnd in the third position if the two of center, middle top and \nmiddle left are available the position is a certain victory. \nThere are many different arrangements of the player\u2019s tokens \nthat give equivalent positions as these three positions. By using \nplanning we do not need to consider all possible layouts but just \nconsider these three similar to what a human would consider. \n The game starts from an empty table. \nThe two relevant strategies that would lead to these positions \nare to take one corner or to take the center [Figure 7]. \nFigure 7: Tic-tac-toe Two starting moves \nThe center position as we can see in the simulation results \nlead to a bigger number of victorious endings but it is also a \nstraight forward strategy with obvious defense strategy. \nAt this point we need to consider the moves of the opponent. \nIf we take the left branch the opponent moves can be a center, a \ncorner or a middle field. We also need to differentiate with a \nmove to a corner adjacent with our like top left or bottom right or \nacross the center to bottom right [Figure 8]. \nFigure 8: Tic-tac-toe opponent response to corner move \nIn cases one and two, we have a clear path to executing \nstrategy 3 so we need to capture the diagonally opposite field. \nAnd as for the third case the best way to go is to capture the center \nand go for strategy 1 or 2 depending of the opponent\u2019s next move.  \nFigure 9: Tic-tac-toe move 2 after corner opening \nThe first move leads to certain victory, O will have to go to \nthe center and X will achieve strategy 3 [Figure 9]. The second \nmove is a possible way to strategy 3 if O makes a mistake in the \nnext loop, so X goes to the opposite corner. For the third case \nsince O is playing a valid strategy the only move that leaves a \npossible mistake from O would be to take the center and wait for \nO to go to the middle and then achieve strategy 1 or 3 which will \nbe a symmetric situation to the one that we will find if we \nbranched with the center. \nFigure 10: Tic-tac-toe opponent response to center move \nIf we go back to the second branch [Figure 10], a possible \nway for the second player to engage is corner or middle. The first \n298\nDIMEA 2008\n3rd International Conference on Digital Interactive Media in Entertainment and Arts\nmove is a valid strategy for O and can be mee\ncorner move from X to try a mistake from O in \nthe same as in the third case above from the pre\nanother move would be go to the middle wh\nachieves strategy 1 or 2.  \nFigure 11: Tic-tac-toe Move 2 after cent\nThe fist move will lead to win if O moves \ndraw if it goes for the corners [Figure 11].

These calculations represent adaptation of the more general \nplanning associated with the cases in the CBR database. These \nadaptations are necessary due to the fact that the cases do not \nidentically correspond to the situation on the table. In addition \ncalculating the game position value of each node of the game tree \nis done by heuristic functions that incorporate economic \ncalculations of net present value, cash, and strategic layout and so \non. For example railroads in monopoly are known to be \nstrategically effective because they bring constant income even \nthough the income can be smaller than building on other \nproperties.  \n6.2 Details on the CBR Implementation \nThe implementation of the CBR is by using the JColibri2 \nplatform.  JColibri2 is an object-oriented framework in Java for \nbuilding CBR systems that is an evolution of previous work on \nknowledge intensive CBR [14].  \nFor this implementation we need to look into three particular \nclasses of the JColibri2 platform. The StandardCBRApplication, \nConnector, CBRQuery. For a JColibri2 implementation the \nStandardCBRApplication interface needs to be implemented.  \nThe CBR cycle executed accepts an instance of CBRQuery. \nThis class represents a CBR query to the CBR database. The \ndescription component (instance of CaseComponent) represents \nthe description of the case that will be looked up in the database. \nAll \ncases \nand \ncase \nsolutions \nare \nimplementing \nthe \nCaseComponent interface. \nThe JColibri2 platform connects to the CBR database via a \nConnector class. Each connector implements all the necessary \nmethods for accessing the database, retrieval of cases, storing and \ndeletion of cases. This implementation uses a custom XML \nstructure for holding the CBR cases. Since the game will not \nupdate the CBR database only read it, a XML solution satisfies \nthe needs. The XML file to a certain extent is similar to the XML \nrepresentation of the board. We are interested in finding one \nCBRCase that is the most similar case to the situation in the game \nat the time of the search. This procedure is done in the cycle \nmethod of the CBRApplication. The JColibri2 CBR comparison is \ndone by Nearest Neighbor (NN) search method.  \nJColibri2 offers implementations for NN search algorithms \nof simple attributes. These implementations are called local \nsimilarities. For complex attributes like in our case global \ncustomized similarity mechanisms need to be implemented. \nThe MonopolyDescription class [Figure 13] is basically a \nserialization of the GameState. It holds all the information about \nthe state of the board, the players, their amount of cash etc.  \nFigure 13: Class diagram of the Monopoly Case component \nmodels \nOn the other hand the MonopolySolution class holds the \nthree particular attributes that are needed for the planning, the \nplanning Domain, State and TaskList. \nThe game is implemented by using the Model-View-\nController software development pattern. The controller is \nresponsible for implementing the game rules and handling all of \nthe events in the game like roll of dice, input commands for \ntrading, auctioning and etc from the players. The View layer is \nresponsible for displaying the board and all of the input widgets \non to the game screen, and the models are data structures \nrepresenting the game state [Figure 14]. \nFigure 14: Class diagram of the Monopoly models \n6.2.1 Complex Similarity representation in CBR \nThe similarity measurement part of the Nearest Neighbor \nalgorithm JColibri2 is implemented by implementing the \nLocalSimiralrityFunction \nand \nthe \nGlobalSimiralityFunction \ninterface. A local similarity function is applied to simple attributes \nby the NN algorithm, and a global similarity function is applied to \ncompound attributes. In the case of our implementation the \nattributes of the MonopolyDescription are compound attributes \ndescribing the state of the board, number of players, amount of \ncash for every player and etc. Since MonopolyDescription is a \ncustom CaseComponent a global similarity function needs to be \nimplemented to accurately find the distance between different \nCBR cases. \nThe similarity mechanism is inseparable core element of the \nCBR system. This mechanism represents how the CBR decides \nwhich strategy is best suited for the particular situation by \n300\nDIMEA 2008\n3rd International Conference on Digital Interactive Media in Entertainment and Arts\ncalculating the distance or similarity to other cases in the \ndatabase.  \nFor the monopoly implementation we need to consider \nseveral basic strategies. Monopoly is based on investing in \nproperties and receiving revenues from those investments. One of \nthe basic strategies of the game is to build a set of properties that \nwill bring constant income larger than the one of the opponents. \nSo in time the opponents will have to declare bankruptcy. But on \nthe other hand over investment can lead to too stretched resources \nwith low income that will eventually drove the player to \nbankruptcy. To decide on these two we need a clear separation \ninto two groups of cases in the CBR database. The first group of \ncases will represent a situation on the board where the player has \nsignificant income per loop formed of one or more color group \nproperties, maybe railroads, some buildings on them and so on. It \nis important to note that in this case the player is better situated \nthan his opponents so he only needs to survive long enough to win \nthe game. In the other group of cases either the opponent is not \nwell positioned on the board or its opponents are better situated. \nIn this case further investments are necessary to improve the \nsituation so the player can have a chance of winning in the long \nrun.  \nThese metrics can be owning color groups, valuing groups of \nrailroads, evaluating the other opponents as well, and considering \nthe amount of cash. As it is obvious in monopoly the number of \nstreets is not as nearly as important as the combination of streets \nthe player owns. It is also important to note that one CBR case \ndoes not hold only a single strategy in place, but its solution can \nhave multiple different strategic goals. For example one CBR case \nmight simultaneously say buy this land to form a color group but \nalso trade some other unimportant property to increase cash \namount.  \nThe cases do not represent all possible combinations of board \npositions. They are only representation of typical game scenarios. \nThe CBR Case solutions do not give exact instructions in general \nbut rather strategic goals. For example one CBR Solution might \nsay trade the streets that you only have one of each for the ones \nthat you have two of that color already. Then the planner based on \nthe situation on the board needs to decompose this high level task \nto a low level operations. Like offer \"Mediterranean Avenue\" for \n\"Reading Railroad\" and offer $50. The exact amounts and actual \nstreets are left to the planer to evaluate.  \nThe monopoly CBR database is currently in development on \na monopoly clone game called Spaceopoly. The cases are \narchitected based on human player experience and knowledge. \nThere is a plan of making a number of slightly different strategies \nthat differ on the style of playing and then running simulation \ntests that would determine the particular validity of each database \nas well as validity of certain segments of the strategy or even \nparticular cases in the database.  \nThe actual execution of the strategies will not differ from \nstrategy to strategy since the plan execution is more related to the \nstructure and rules of the game than to the actual playing strategy. \n6.3 Details on the Planning Implementation \nFor the purpose of planning this implementation uses a \nmodification of the JSHOP2 planner. The Java Simple \nHierarchical Ordered Planner 2 is a domain independent HTN \nplanning system [15].  \nJSHOP2 uses ordered task decomposition in reducing the \nHTN to list of primitive tasks which form the plans. An ordered \ntask decomposition planner is an HTN planner that plans for tasks \nin the same order that they will be executed. This reduces the \ncomplexity of reasoning by removing a great deal of uncertainty \nabout the world, which makes it easy to incorporate substantial \nexpressive power into the planning algorithm. In addition to the \nusual HTN methods and operators, the planners can make use of \naxioms, can do mixed symbolic/numeric conditions, and can do \nexternal function calls. \n In order for the JSHOP2 planer to generate plans it needs \ntree crucial components: Domain, State and Tasks. The Domain \ndefines all the functionalities that the particular domain offers. \nThese are simple and complex tasks. The complex tasks also \ncalled methods create the hierarchy with the fact that they can be \nevaluated by simple tasks of other complex tasks. This is how a \nhierarchical structure of tasks is formed. The problem reduction is \ndone by reducing the high level complex tasks to simpler until all \nthe tasks are primitive. The list of primitive tasks forms the plan. \nThe State represents the state of the system. It is a simple \ndatabase of facts that represent the state of the system. The State \nis necessary to determine the way the problems or tasks are \nreduced to their primitive level. The reduction is done by \nsatisfying different prerequisites set in the methods; these \nprerequisites are defined in the state. The Tasks are high level \ntasks or methods defined in the Domain. The planner based on the \nState and the goals selects one or more high level tasks that need \nto be reduced to plans [Figure  15]. \nFigure 15: Diagram of a Planner \nThe plans then generate the game moves. The number of \nmoves generated by the plans is just a fraction of the possible \nmoves at that point. This reduces the game tree providing the \nopportunity to generate smaller and deeper game trees and making \nmore efficient decisions in general.  \n7. Conclusion \nEven though the results from the CBR database are not \ncomplete at this time partial strategies are implemented as cases \nand recognized during game play by the CBR system. These \nsmaller local strategies coupled with more global higher level \nstrategies that are particularly important at the beginning of the \ngame would form a complete CBR database and represent a \nknowledge engineered style of playing of the AI player.  \nThe AI Planning approach is a proven method by the tic-tac-\ntoe experiment and is suitable for implementing the strategies \nassociated with the CBR cases. \nThis approach in general benefits from both technologies, \nCBR as well as AI Planning and comprises an elegant solution. \nEven though AI Planning can be enough as a single technology \nfor some simpler problems like tic-tac-toe the complexity of \nMonopoly would mean that the Planner would have to incorporate \nCore Planner \nTasks\nPlan\nState\nInteractive and Adaptable Media\n301\n3rd International Conference on Digital Interactive Media in Entertainment and Arts\nlarge and complex domain and a very big state model. The CBR \napplication helps reduce this complexity by focusing the planning \non smaller domain of the game. Basically the CBR reduces the \noverall goal of the play (wining the game) to smaller more \nconcrete goals suitable to the particular state of the game, thus \nreducing the need for global planning strategies and complex \nplanning domain.  \nFurthermore this symbiosis of technologies gives way for \nmore precise and finely tuned strategies which can be difficult to \ninclude into global plan for the whole game. One simple example \nfor the Monopoly game would be this: Sometimes it\u2019s better to \nstay in jail because rolling double increases the probability of \nlanding on some field (two, four, six, eight, ten or twelve steps \nfrom the jail) that can be of great importance to the rest of the \ngame. These and similar small local strategies can be easily \nrecognized by similar cases in the CBR database.  \nIn other words the system is flexible enough so that new \nstrategies can be incorporated easily missing strategies can be also \nrecognized by the distance metrics as well as wrong assumptions \nin the strategies can be easily recognized. \nOne other important property of the system is that is highly \nconfigurable. The game its self can be diversely different \ndepending on the configuration of the board. Even though the \nplatform is restricted to Monopoly type of games, changing the \nlayout and values of the fields effectively brings completely \ndifferent properties of the game. In addition the CBR database \nrepresents the entire experience of the AI Player. It can be filled \nwith rich set of strategies or even configured with different flavors \nof difficulties of play, this of course coupled with the domain of \nthe planner which can differ from a case to a case as well.  \n8. Future Work \nFurther exploration of this technology would go towards \ncomplete implementation of an AI aware agent for monopoly. \nInitial results from the local cases with more specific strategies \nshow CBR as a capable tool for representing expertise in playing \nthe game. Completing the more general strategies and coupling \nthem with the planning domain will give precise results on the \nbenefits from this architecture. \nThere is also need for exploring the planning of strategies of \nopponents. This task is to some extent different because we \ncannot always expect the opponent to select the best move we \nthink. In the Tic-tac-toe example all possible moves of the \nopponent were taken into consideration, if we used the same \nplanner for the opponent only tie games would result from the \ngame tree. In other words mistakes of the players also need to be \nconsidered.  \nThe CBR Platform brings other functionalities well worth of \nexploring as well. The revision stage of the JColibri2 platform is \nbasically capable of fine tuning strategies or even developing new \nstrategies for the games. A well written underlying AI planning \nmodel with a capable feedback of the game tree evaluation back \nto the CBR revision capability can be an interesting concept in \nautomatic experience acquisition for the AI model. \nThere are also many other fields were combined CBR and \nplanning approach can be incorporated into a problem solution. \nThis combination is analogous in a big extent to a human way of \nreasoning. People in addition to logic of reasoning in situations \nwith lack of information rely to planning strategies and prior \nexperience, exactly the intuition behind CBR \u2013 AI Planning \narchitecture.  \n9.

This is likely due to a fact that the\ninvestment necessary for engaging in the spamming industry is\nrelatively low. As a result of this, we currently have a system that\nidentifies every email as suspicious, which has caused major expen-\nditures in the investment of defense systems [12]. Emails are used\nfor online crimes like fraud, hacking, phishing, E-mail bombing, bul-\nlying, and spamming. [16]. Algorithms that are based on machine\nlearning (ML) are now the most effective and often used approach to\nthe recognition of spam. Phishing, which is defined as a fraudulent\nattempt to acquire private information by masquerading as a trust-\nworthy party in electronic communication, has rapidly advanced\npast use of simple techniques and the tactic of casting a wide net;\ninstead, spear phishing uses a variety of sophisticated techniques\nto target a single high-value individual. Other researchers used NB,\nDecision Trees, and SVM to compare the performance of supervised\nML algorithms for spam identification [6]. Spam emails clog up re-\ncipients\u2019 inboxes with unsolicited communications, which frustrate\nthem and push them into the attacker\u2019s planned traps [7]. As a re-\nsult, spam messages unquestionably pose a risk to both email users\nand the Internet community. In addition, Users may occasionally\nread the entire text of an unsolicited message that is delivered to\nthe target users\u2019 inboxes without realizing that the message is junk\nand then choosing to avoid it. Building a framework for email spam\ndetection is the aim of this project. In this approach, we combine the\nWord-Embedding Network with the CNN layer, Bi-LSTM, and GRU\n(BiLSTM+GRU). CNN layers are used to speed up training time\nbefore the Bi-LSTM network, and more advanced textual character-\nistics are extracted with the use of this network in comparison to\nthe straight LSTM network, in less time. Gated recurrent neural net-\nworks (GRUs) are then added because they train more quickly and\nperform better for language modeling. To evaluate and investigate\nvarious machine learning algorithms for predicting email spam,\nand develop a hybrid classification algorithm to filter email spam\nbefore employing an ensemble classification algorithm to forecast\nit. To put an innovative technique into practice and compare it to\nthe current method in terms of various metrics. Ensemble learn-\ning, a successful machine learning paradigm, combines a group of\nlearners rather than a single learner to forecast unknown target\nattributes. Bagging, boosting, voting, and stacking are the four main\ntypes of ensemble learning techniques. To increase performance,\nan integrated method and the combining of two or three algorithms\nare also suggested. Extraction of text-based features takes a long\ntime. Furthermore, it can be challenging to extract all of the crucial\ninformation from a short text. Over the span associated with this\n181\nIC3 2023, August 03\u201305, 2023, Noida, India\nSachan et al.\nresearch, we utilize Bidirectional Large Short-Term Memories (Bi-\nLSTM) in conjunction with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nto come up with an innovative method to the detection of spam.\nBagging and boosting approaches were widely preferred in this\nstudy. Contribution and paper organization is as follows: section 1.1\ndescribes literature study, section 1.2 describe motivation for this\nresearch work, section 2 sketches procedure of details implemen-\ntation, Section 3 present experimental setup, dataset description\nand evaluation metrics, and section 4 summarizing outcomes of the\nexperiment.\n1.1\nRelated Work\nEmail is indeed the second most frequently utilized Internet appli-\ncation as well as the third most common method of cyberbullying,\nclaims one study. Cybercriminals exploit it in a number of ways,\nincluding as sending obscene or abusive messages, adding viruses\nto emails, snatching the private information of victims, and ex-\nposing it to a broad audience. Spam letters made up 53.95% of all\nemail traffic in March 2020. We examine three main types of un-\nlawful emails in our study. First are fake emails, which are sent\nto manipulate recipients to submit sensitive information. The sec-\nond as being cyberbullying\u2019s use of harassing emails to threaten\nindividuals. Suspicious emails that describe illegal activities belong\nto the third category. Many researchers have earlier contributed\nmassively to this subject. The researcher claims there is some proof\nthat suspicious emails were sent before to the events of 9/11. [14].\nWhen it comes to data labeling, there are also convinced rule-based\napproaches and technologies ( like VADER) that are used, even\nthough their efficiency of the are together is adversely affected. A\nhidden layer, which itself is essential for vectorization, is the top\nlayer of the model. We use oversampling methods for this minority\nclass because of the absence of data. Sampling techniques can help\nwith multicollinearity, but they have an impact on simulation re-\nsults. Oversampling causes data to be randomly repeated, which\naffects test data because dividing data may result in duplicates. Un-\ndersampling may result in the loss of some strong information. In\norder to advance email research, it is crucial to provide datasets on\ncriminal activity. P. Garg et al. (2021) [5], which revealed that spam\nin an email was detected in 70 percent of business emails, spam was\nestablished as an obstacle for email administrators. Recognizing\nspam and getting rid of it were the primary concerns, as spam can\nbe offensive, may lead to other internet sites being tricked, which\ncan offer harmful data, and can feature those who are not particu-\nlar with their content using NLP. To select the best-trained model,\neach mail transmission protocol requires precise and effective email\nclassification, a machine learning comparison is done. Our study\nhas suggested that innovative deep learning outperforms learning\nalgorithms like SVM and RF. Current studies on the classification\nof emails use a variety of machine learning (ML) techniques, with\na few of them focusing on the study of the sentiments consisted of\nwithin email databases. The lack of datasets is a significant obstacle\nto email classification. There are few publicly accessible E-mail\ndatasets, thus researchers must use these datasets to test their hy-\npotheses or gather data on their own. Authors[15] describe supplied\ntwo-phased outlier detection models to enhance the IIOT network\u2019s\ndependability. Artificial Neural Network, SVM, Gaussian NB, and\nRF (random forest) ensemble techniques were performed to forecast\nclass labels, and the outputs were input into a classifying unit to\nincrease accuracy. A method for content-based phishing detection\nwas presented by the authors in [2], to classify phishing emails,\nthey employed RF. They categorize spam and phishing emails. They\nenhanced phishing email classifiers with more accurate predictions\nby extracting features. They showed some effective Machine learn-\ning spam filtering techniques. When the PCA method is used, it will\nlower the number of features in the dataset. The collected features\ngo through the PCA algorithm to reduce the number of features.\nThe PCA method is used to make a straightforward representation\nof the information which illustrates the amount of variability there\nis in the data. The authors of [20] presented the Fuzzy C-means\nmethod for classifying spam email. To stop spam, they implemented\na membership threshold value. A methodology to identify unla-\nbeled data was put forth by the authors of [1] and applied motive\nanalysis to the Enron data collection. They divided the data into\ncategories that were favorable, negative, and neutral. They grouped\nthe data using k-means clustering, an unsupervised ML technique\nand then classified it using the supervised ML techniques SVM and\nNB. Hina, Maryam, and colleagues (2021) implemented Sefaced:\nDeep learning-based semantic analysis and categorization of e-mail\ndata using a forensic technique. For multiclass email classification,\nSeFACED employs a Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRU) based\non Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Different random weight ini-\ntializations affect LSTMs [9]. Zhang, Yan, et al.(2019) Experiments\non three-way game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) email spam filter-\ning show that it is feasible to significantly boost coverage without\ndecreasing accuracy [23]. According to Xia et al. [22], SMS spam\nhas been identified using machine learning model such as naive\nbayes , vector-space modeling, support vector machines (SVM),\nlong selective memory machines (LSTM), and convolutional neural\nnetworks including every instance of a method for categorizing\ndata. Elshoush, Huwaida, et al. (2019) Using adaboost and stochastic\ngradient descent (sgd) algorithms for e-mail filtering with R and\norange software spam [3]. Orange software was used to create the\nclassifications, which included Adaboost and SGD. The majority of\nresearchers focused on text-based email spam classification meth-\nods because image-based spam can be filtered in the early stages\nof pre-processing. There are widely used word bag (BoW) model,\nwhich believes that documents are merely unordered collections\nof words, is the foundation for these techniques. Kumaresan [11]\nexplains SVM with a cuckoo search algorithm was used to extract\ntextual features for spam detection. Renuka and Visalakshi made\nuse of svm [17] spam email identification, followed by selecting\nfeatures using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Here we have used\nlabeled dataset to train the hybrid classifier. We used TF-IDF for\nfeature extraction [20] and Textual features for spam detection\nwere extracted using SVM and a cuckoo search algorithm. [4] for\nfiltering out the spam email. Combining the integrated strategy to\nthe pure SVM and NB methods, overall accuracy is really improved.\nMoreover, accurate detection for spam email has been proposed\nusing the Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) and Particle Swarm\nOptimization\u2019s (PSO) algorithm. PSO is used in this instance to\nimprove the effectiveness of the classifier.\n182\nSemantic Analysis and Classification of Emails through Informative Selection of Features and Ensemble AI Model\nIC3 2023, August 03\u201305, 2023, Noida, India\n1.2\nMotivation and Novelty\nEmail is most common form of communication between people\nin this digital age. Many users have been victims of spam emails,\nand their personal information has been compromised. The email\nClassification technique is employed to identify and filter junk\nmail, junk, and virus-infected emails prior to reach a user\u2019s inbox.\nExisting email classification methods result in irrelevant emails\nand/or the loss of valuable information. Keeping these constraints\nin mind, the following contributions are made in this paper:\n\u2022 Text-based feature extraction is a lengthy process. Further-\nmore, extracting every important feature from text is difficult.\nIn this paper, we show how to employ GRU with Convo-\nlutional Neural Networks and Bidirectional-LSTM to find\nspam.\n\u2022 Used Word-Embeddings, BiLSTM, and Gated Recurrent Neu-\nral Networks to examine the relationships, sentimental con-\ntent, and sequential way of email contents.\n\u2022 Applied CNN before the Bi-LSTM network, training time can\nbe sped up. This network can also extract more advanced\ntextual features faster than the Bi-LSTM network alone when\ncombined with the GRU network.\n\u2022 We use Enorn Corpora datasets and compute precision, re-\ncall, and f-score to assess how well the suggested technique\nperforms. Our model outperforms several well-known ma-\nchine learning techniques as well as more contemporary\nmethods for spam message detection.\n2\nPROPOSED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND\nMODEL\nE-mail is a valuable tool for communicating with other users. Email\nallows the sender to efficiently forward millions of advertisements\nat no cost. Unfortunately, this scheme is now being used in a variety\nof organizations. As a result, a massive amount of redundant emails\nis known as spam or junk mail, many people are confused about the\nemails in their E- Mailboxes. Each learning sequence is given for-\nward as well as backward to two different LSTM networks that are\nattached to the same outputs layer in order for bidirectional Lstms\nto function. This indicates that the Bi-LSTM has detailed sequential\ninformation about all points before and following each point in a\nspecific sequence. In other words, we concatenate the outputs from\nboth the forward and the backward LSTM at each time step rather\nthan just encoding the sequence in the forward direction. Each\nword\u2019s encoded form now comprehends the words that come before\nand after it. This is a problem for the Internet community. The di-\nagram depicts various stages that aid in the prediction of email spam:\nBecause real-world data is messy and contains unnecessary infor-\nmation and duplication, data preprocessing is critical in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP). The major preprocessing steps are de-\npicted below.\n2.1\nNLP Tokenization\nTokenization of documents into words follows predefined rules.\nThe tokenization step is carried out in Python with spacy library.\n2.2\nStop Words Removal\nStop words appear infrequently or frequently in the document, but\nthey are less significant in terms of importance. As a result, these\nare removed to improve data processing.\n2.3\nText Normalization\nA word\u2019s lexicon form or order may differ. Thus, they must all be\nchanged to their root word to be correctly analyzed. Lemmatization\nand stemming are the two methods that can be used for normal-\nization. When a word\u2019s final few characters are removed to create\na shorter form, even if that form has no meaning, the procedure\nis known as stemming. lemmatization [21] is a mixture of corpus-\nbased an rule-based methods, and it retains the context of a term\nwhile changing it back to its root.\n2.4\nFeature Extraction\nfeature extraction which transforms the initial text into its features\nso that it may be used for modeling after being cleaned up and\nnormalized. Before predicting them, we use a specific way to give\nweights to specific terms in our document. While it is simple for a\ncomputer to process numbers, we choose to represent individual\nwords numerically. In such cases, we choose word embeddings. IDF\nis the count of documents containing the term divided by the total\nnumber of documents, and occurrence is the amount of instances a\nword appears in a document. We derive characteristics based on\nequations. 1,2,3,4,5, and 6. We use equations to derive properties.\n\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 = \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc53 \u2217\n\ufffd 1\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53\n\ufffd\n(1)\n\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 = \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc53 \u2217 Inverse(\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 )\n(2)\n\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc37) = \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc51).\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc37)\n(3)\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc51) = log\n\ud835\udc41\n|\ud835\udc51\ud835\udf16\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61\ud835\udf16\ud835\udc37|\n(4)\nA word2vec neural network-based approach is the method that is\nutilized for this goal as the tool. The following equation, referred\nto as 5, shows how word2vec handles word context through the\nuse of probability-accurate measurements. Here letter D stands for\nthe paired-wise display of a set of words, while the letters w and c0\nor c1 represent paired word context that originated from a larger\ncollection of set D.\n\ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc37 = 1 | \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc5011:\ud835\udc58) =\n1\n1 + \ud835\udc52\u2212(\ud835\udc64\u00b7\ud835\udc5011+\ud835\udc64\u00b7\ud835\udc5012+...+\ud835\udc64\u00b7\ud835\udc501\ud835\udc58)\n(5)\n\ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc37 = 1 | \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc501:\ud835\udc58) =\n1\n1 + \ud835\udc52\u2212(\ud835\udc64\u00b7\ud835\udc500)\n(6)\n183\nIC3 2023, August 03\u201305, 2023, Noida, India\nSachan et al.\n2.5\nWord-Embeddings\nWord-Embedding helps to improve on the typical \"bag-of-words\"\nworldview, which requires a massive sparse feature vector to score\nevery word individually to represent this same entire vocabulary.\nThis perception is sparse because the vocabulary is large, and each\nword or document is defined by a massive vector. Using a word\nmap-based dictionary, word embedding needs to be converted terms\n(words) into real value feature vectors. There are two basic issues\nwith standard feature engineering techniques for deep learning.\nData is represented using sparse vectors, and the second is that\nsome of the meanings of words are not taken into consideration.\nSimilar phrases will have values in embedding vectors that are\nalmost real-valued. The Input length in our proposed study is set\nto 700 for our suggested model. If the texts seemed to be integer\nencoded with value systems between 10 and 20, the vocabulary\ndistance would be 11. Our data is encoded as integers, and the input\nand output dimensions are both set to 50,000. The embedding layer\noutcome will be used in successive layers and for BiLSTM and GRU\nlayers.\n2.6\nMachine Learning Model\nWithin the scope of the research, we are using the subsequent ma-\nchine learning techniques, to examine and compare the overall\nefficacy of our suggested Bi-LSTM strategy: Support Vector Ma-\nchine, Gaussian NB, Logistic Regression, K - nearest neighbors, and\nRandom Forest (RF).\n2.7\nConvolution Network\nThe popular RNN model generally performs well but takes too\nlong to train the model incorporating the textual sequential data.\nWhen a layer is added after the RNN layer, the model\u2019s learning\nduration is considerably decreased. Higher-level feature extraction\nis another benefit. [19] additionally possible using the convolutional\nlayer. In essence, the convolution layer looks for combinations of\nthe various words or paragraphs in the document that involve the\nfilters. We use features with 128 dimensions and a size 10 for each.\nFor this task, the Relu activation function is utilized. After that, the\none-dimensional largest pooling layers with a pooling size of 4 are\nput on the data in order to obtain higher-level features.\n2.8\nBiLSTM Network with GRU\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique of text sentiment anal-\nysis is particularly well-liked and frequently applied. Recurrent\nneural networks (RNN) surpass conventional neural networks. be-\ncause it can remember the information from earlier time steps\nthanks to its memory. A state vector is combined with an RNN\u2019s\ndata to create a new state vector. The resulting state vector uses the\npresent to recollect past knowledge. The RNN is straightforward\nand is based on the following equations:\n\u210e\ud835\udc61 = tanh (\ud835\udc4a\u210e\u210e\u210e\ud835\udc61\u22121 +\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udf0b\u210e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61)\n(7)\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc4a\u210e\ud835\udc66\u210e\ud835\udc61\n(8)\nThe vanilla RNN[18]is not very good at remembering previous\nsequences. In addition to that, RNN struggles with diminishing\ngradient descent. A kind of RNN is a long short-term recall network\n(LSTM), solves a vanishing gradient descent problem and learns\nlong-term dependencies[10]. LSTM was actually created to address\nthe problem of long-term reliance. LSTM has the unique ability to\nrecall. The cell state is the LSTM model\u2019s central concept. With\nonly a small amount of linear interaction, the cell state follows the\nsequence essentially unmodified from beginning to end. gate of\nan LSTM is also significant. Under the command of these gates,\ninformation is safely inserted to or eliminated from the cell stated.\nThe following equations are used by the LSTM model to update\neach cell:\n\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf0e\n\ufffd\n\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc53 \u00b7 [\u210e\ud835\udc61\u22121,\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61] + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc53\n\ufffd\n(9)\nIn this case, Xt denotes input, and ht is the hidden state at the t\ntime step. The following is the revised cell state Ct:\n\ud835\udc56t = \ud835\udf0e (\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 [\u210e\ud835\udc61\u22121,\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61] + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56)\n(10)\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc47 = tanh (\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc50 [\u210e\ud835\udc61\u22121,\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61] + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61)\n(11)\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61 \u2217 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 \u2217 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc47\n(12)\nHere, we may compute the output and hidden state at t time steps\nusing the point-wise multiplication operator *.\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf0e (\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc5c \u00b7 [\u210e\ud835\udc61\u22121,\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61] + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5c)\n(13)\n\u210e\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61 \u2217 tanh (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61)\n(14)\nDue to the reality it only considers all prior contexts from the\npresent one, LSTM does have a few drawbacks. As a result of this,\nit may accept data from preceding time steps through LSTM as well\nas RNN. Therefore, in order to avoid this issue, further improve-\nments are carried out with the help of a bidirectional recurrent\nneural network(Bi-RNN). BiRNN [13] can handle two pieces of in-\nformation from both the front and the back. Bi-LSTM is created\nby combining the Bi-RNN and LSTM. As a result, operating LSTM\nhas advantages such as cell state storage so that BiRNN have way\nto acknowledge from the context before and after. As a conse-\nquence of this, it provides the Bi-LSTM with the advantages of an\nLSTM with feedback for the next layer. Remembering long-term\ndependencies is a significant new benefit of Bi-LSTM. The output,\nwhich is a feature vector, will be based on the call state. Finally,\nwe forecast the probability of email content as Normal, Fraudu-\nlent, Harassment, and Suspicious Emails using as an input to the\nsoftmax activation function, which is a weighted sum of the dense\nlayer\u2019s outputs. To regulate the information flow, GRU employs\nthe point-wise multiplying function and logistic sigmoid activation.\nThe GRU has hidden states of storage memory and does not have\ndistinct memory cells or units for state control. The W, U, and b\nvectors, which stand for weights, gates, and biases, respectively, are\ncrucial variables that must be calculated during the creation of the\nGRU model. For training reasons, the pre-trained word embedding\nknown as the Glove vector is used. They made it clear that GRU\nis the superior model when there is a large amount of training\ndata for textual groups and word embedding is available. BiLSTM,\nCNN, and GRU is required so as to compensate for the deletion\nof the document\u2019s long-term and short-term connections. In our\ncase, the embedding dimension, maximum sequence length, and\nlexicon size were used to start the LSTM embedding layer in three\nseparate LSTM models. The input vector was modified to make it\nappropriate for such a Conv1D layer, prior situations\u2019 sequences are\nreturned by LSTM layer. The \"return sequences\" of the LSTM layer\nmust be set to False when the subsequent state is free of the gated\n184\nSemantic Analysis and Classification of Emails through Informative Selection of Features and Ensemble AI Model\nIC3 2023, August 03\u201305, 2023, Noida, India\narchitecture. Quantity of learning parameters must be taken into\nconsideration. A 350-unit LSTM layer was set - up, and different\nLSTM unit combinations were tested. More importantly, because\nit has more parts, the model made with BiLSTM will take longer\nto train. Bidirectional LSTM is the name of a particular kind of\nrecurrent neural network that is primarily used for the processing\nof natural languages. (BiLSTM). It is able to use data from both\nsides, and, in contrast to regular LSTM, it enables input flow in\nboth directions. It is an effective instrument for demonstrating the\nlogical relationships between words and phrases, and this involves\nboth the forward and backward directions of the sequence. In con-\nclusion, BiLSTM works by adding one extra layer of LSTM, causing\nthe information flow to travel in the other direction. It only denotes\nthat the input sequence runs in reverse at the next LSTM layer. Mul-\ntiple operations, including averaging, summation, multiplication,\nand concatenation, are then applied to the results of the two LSTM\nlayers. The gated design of Bi-LSTM and GRU networks solves\nthe disappearing gradient and exploding problems. A good way to\nhandle more long sequences is to use Bi-LSMT and GRU together.\nGRU works well with datasets that don\u2019t have text. In two to three\nrounds, the complicated CNN+BiLSTM+GRU model learns the long\nsequence of email text well. We have used word embedding, cnn,\nbidirectional lstm and gru networks as our three building blocks\nto separate email messages based on their sentiment and text\u2019s\nsequential features. Also, we succinctly demonstrate below why\nthese blocks help identify email spam:\n\u2022 First, We have used the Sequence - to - sequence Lstm as the\ncurrent block in the networks since it can retrieve both the\nprevious and next sequences from the current. More so than\na straightforward LSTM network, it can also recognize and\nextract text sentiment and sequential properties.\n\u2022 Second, we extract the more complex and advanced charac-\nteristics for Bi-LSTM network using Convolutional Network\nblock, which is the network\u2019s second block after the Bi-LSTM\nblock. Bi-LSTM takes a long time to extract text-based fea-\ntures, hence one of the reasons for using this block is to\nreduce the network\u2019s overall training time.\n3\nEXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\n3.1\nExperimental Setup\nWe divided the information into training and testing groups of\n80/20. We divided the remaining 20% of the 80 percent training\ndata into test data for the model. Construct, compute, and evaluate\nthe efficacy of the suggested method using the Pythonic packages\nKeras, as TensorFlow and Scikit learn.\n3.2\nDataset Description\nEmail spam detection is the foundation of this research project. The\ndataset includes normal emails from the Enron corpora, deceptive\nemails from phished email corpora, harassment emails chosen from\nhate speech, and the offensive dataset. Only the content of the email\nbody is used for analysis; all header information, including sender,\ntopic, CC, and BCC, are eliminated. Word2vector, TF-IDF, and Word\nEmbedding are used to extract characteristics from the email mes-\nsage and classify them. This dataset[8] is publicly available. The\npresented model is implemented using Python, and several metrics,\nincluding accuracy, precision, and recall, are used to examine the\noutcomes.\n3.3\nEvaluation Metrics and Results\nClassifier performance is assessed Using metrics such as accuracy,\nprecision, and recall. Four terms make up a confusion matrix that\nis used to calculate these metrics.\n\u2022 True positives (TP) are positive values that have been accu-\nrately assigned the positive label.\n\u2022 The negative values that are accurately identified as negative\nare known as True Negatives (TN).\n\u2022 True Negative values are those that can be accurately identi-\nfied as being negative (TN).\n\u2022 Positive readings that have been mistakenly labeled as nega-\ntive are known as False Negatives (FN).\nAssess the efficacy of the suggested model is listed below:\n3.3.1\nAccuracy. Accuracy reveals how frequently the ML model\nwas overall correct.\nAccuracy =\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43 +\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43 +\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc41 + \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc43 + \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc41\n(15)\n3.3.2\nPrecision.

In the\nCNN, Bi-LSTM, and GRU architectures which enable sequence pre-\ndiction, CNN strands for feature extraction on data input which are\ncombined with LSTM. It requires less time training and a higher\nexpandable model. Any bottlenecks are created by predictions and\nthe increasing number of distinct units of information. This model\nis useful for dealing with issue-related classifications that consist\nof two or more than two classes. So suggested Ensemble model, out\nof these six classifiers, produces more accurate findings.\n185\nIC3 2023, August 03\u201305, 2023, Noida, India\nSachan et al.\nFigure 1: Performance Analysis\n3.4\nComparative Analysis\nA model\u2019s ability to fit new data is measured by the validation\nloss, whereas its ability to fit training data is determined by the\ntraining loss. The two main variables that decide whether in which\nlearning is efficient or not are validation loss and training loss.\nLSTM and Suggested Ensemble hybrid Models have equivalent loss\nand accuracy. In this context, we are contrasting the LSTM with the\nproposed model (CNN, Bilstm, and GRU) in terms of their respective\nvalidation accuracies and losses. The model\u2019s accuracy was at its\nhighest after 14 epochs of operation when it achieved an accuracy\nof roughly 97-98% while minimizing model loss.\nFigure 2: LSTM Model Training and Validation Accuracy\nFigure 3: LSTM Model Training and Validation Loss\nFigure 4: Ensemble Model (CNN,BiLSTM+GRU) Training\nand Validation Accuracy\nFigure 5: Ensemble Model (CNN,BiLSTM+GRU)Training\nand Validation Loss\n186\nSemantic Analysis and Classification of Emails through Informative Selection of Features and Ensemble AI Model\nIC3 2023, August 03\u201305, 2023, Noida, India\nIn this Proposed ensemble hybrid model\u2019s train accuracy is 98.7%\nValidation accuracy is 97.32% and LSTM has train accuracy of 97.41%\nand validation accuracy is 95.2%. So based on figures 3 and 5 indicate\nthe validation loss for LSTM and the proposed ensemble hybrid\nmodel to be 0.93 and 0.84, respectively, and figures 2 and 4 show the\nvalidation accuracy to be 95.2% and 97.3%, respectively. LSTM and\nthe proposed hybrid model used ensemble artificial intelligence,\nwith the proposed hybrid model outperforming the LSTM. We\ndecide on dense architecture as the final model for identifying the\ntext messages as spam or nonspam based on loss, accuracy, and the\naforementioned charts. The loss and accuracy over epochs are more\nstable than LSTM, and the Proposed classifier has a straightforward\nstructure.\n4\nCONCLUSION\nThe model is composed of four networks Word-Embeddings, CNN,\nBi-LSTM, and GRU. We may train the model more quickly by using\nthe convolutional layer first, followed by the word-embedding layer,\nand then the BiLSTM network. The Bidirectional LSTM network\nalso has higher-level properties that we can extract. We have used\na bidirectional LSTM(BiLSTM)and GRU network to memorize a\nsentence\u2019s contextual meaning and sequential structure, which im-\nproves the model\u2019s performance accuracy to roughly 97.32 percent.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Rayan Salah Hag Ali and Neamat El Gayar. 2019.

This adoption seeks, for example, to improve the en-\ngagement of developers while creating UML models or writing\ncode. Empirical studies [7, 9, 14] report that UML models suffer\nfrom incompleteness and inconsistency problems. Lange [14] rein-\nforces that these defects bring potential risks that can cause mis-\ninterpretation and communication failure, representing a risk to\nsoftware quality. Thus, finding formats that favor student learning\nand consequently in generating increasingly effective UML mod-\nels can become one of the main challenges faced by instructors\nthat include UML (Unified Modeling Language) as part of software\nmodeling content.\nSome studies [3, 12, 25] sought to understand how to apply gam-\nification in software modeling teaching using some elements such\nas points, emblems and levels. However, instructors and researchers\nstill find limitations when applying, evaluating, and measuring the\nuse of this tool in the learning of software modeling students and,\nconsequently, in the models developed by them, since in the current\nliterature there is no \u201cframe of reference\u201d that guides them. This\nstudy conjectures that gamification mechanics can improve learner\nengagement while learning software modeling, mitigating such\nproblems concerning UML models. The current literature lacks\nstudies that explore gamification and model quality in the context\nof software modeling learning.\nThis article, therefore, introduces ModelGame, which is a quality\nmodel to support software modeling learning in a gamified way.\nIt serves as a reference framework so that instructors can obtain\na parameterized way to evaluate UML models created by learners.\nThe quality of UML models can be improved by applying gami-\nfied activities and providing guidelines aware of quality issues. A\nreference framework would help to (1) establish parameters for eval-\nuating UML models created by learners; (2) provide guidelines to\nimprove the quality of these artifacts; (3) to analyze which elements\nof gamification could be included in each of the phases of modeling\nusing UML; (4) identify intrinsic and extrinsic aspects of students\nduring the modeling stages, to improve the models; (5) to compare\nvalidated theories about the inclusion of gamification in software\nmodeling teaching, taking into account the types of learning and\nmethodologies used; and (6) contributing to the identification of\ngamification use objectives in modeling activities.\nA qualitative questionnaire was answered by 19 instructors who\nteach software modeling at higher education institutions. The re-\nsults show that (1) 94.7% recognize that the proposed model can\nimprove the quality of UML models, indicating that they would\nadopt it in their learning practices; and (2) 47.4% do not use any\n100\nSBCARS \u201921, September 27-October 1, 2021, Joinville, Brazil\nEd Wilson J\u00fanior and Kleinner Farias\ngamification mechanics in their classes. These results are encourag-\ning, showing the potential for applying and improving the teaching\nand learning of software modeling.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2\npresents the main concepts discussed throughout the article. Sec-\ntion 3 discusses the related work, highlighting research opportu-\nnities. Section 4 introduces the proposed quality model. Section 5\npresents how the quality model was evaluated. Section 6 points out\nsome threats to validity. Finally, Section 7 presents some concluding\nremarks and future work.\n2\nBACKGROUND\nThis section presents the essential concepts for understanding this\nwork, including gamification and software engineering teaching\n(Section 2.1), and software modeling and model quality (Section\n2.2).\n2.1\nGamification and Software Engineering\nTeaching\nGamification aims to use game elements in the context of not game\n[5], bringing all positive aspects they provide as a way to encourage\nand engage \u201cplayers,\u201d thereby broadening their motivations.\nWerbach [23] classifies gamification into three dimensions: Dy-\nnamics, Mechanics, and Components. Dynamicsinclude all game\naspects related to the emotional responses of \u201cplayers\u201d (e.g., rela-\ntionship, progression, and narrative).Mechanics offer elements that\npromote the action of a game \u2014 usually elaborated via a rule-based\ndevelopment \u2014, so that the player can interact with such elements,\ne.g., challenges, feedback, and rewards. Components represent\nthe aesthetic elements of gamification, whose goal is to present\nvisual aspects with which players can perform the interaction, for\nexample, points, scores, and emblems (badges).\nKnowing that the teaching of Software Engineering should in-\nvolve students to experience the professional practices of the area\nso that they can understand which practices and techniques are\nuseful in several different situations [2]. The challenges of teaching\nnew software engineers are not limited to learning programming,\nbut also include paying attention to detail, considering the quality\nof created models, established schedule and defined budgets [1]. In\naddition to understanding the technical challenges, these future\nprofessionals must be up to date with nontechnical issues, including\nteamwork, communication and management.\nTo meet these new demands of the current context, the format\nwith exhibition classes is no longer considered enough and may\neven become demotivating and ineffective in learning students. In\nthis sense, gamification has been increasingly used in the teach-\ning of software engineering as a way to promote behavioral and\npsychological changes [11] providing an environment that favors\ncommunication, cooperation, feedback, reward, achievement and\nother recurring elements that are capable of improving perfor-\nmance, efficiency and engagement in educational activities , and\ncan enhance, for example, the learning of software modeling.\n2.2\nSoftware Modeling and Model Quality\nSoftware modeling encompasses the set of principles, concepts, and\npractices that lead to the development of a high-quality system or\nproduct. The principles of this activity establish a philosophy that\nguides the entire software development process.\nIn this scenario, UML models play a crucial role in software\ndevelopment tasks, for example, documenting project decisions,\nunderstanding development details, promoting better communica-\ntion between teams, and generating greater efficiency in software\ndevelopment [19]. However, these models suffer problems of in-\nconsistency and incompleteness [10, 18], as well as end up being\noverlooked within the modeling process, as pointed out in some\nempirical studies in the literature [14, 15]. Class and sequence dia-\ngrams, for example, present inconsistencies when sequence diagram\nobjects are not found in the class diagram, consequently developers\nend up living with inconsistencies throughout the development\nprocess.\nA research challenge still open is how to evaluate these diagrams,\nboth in industry and in the teaching process, in terms of quality,\nsuch as syntactic and semantic, for example.\n3\nRELATED WORK\nThe selection of related works was carried out following two steps:\n(1) search in digital repositories, such as Google Scholar and Scopus\n(Elsevier) of articles related to gamification, quality modeling, and\nmodeling learning; and (2) filter selected articles considering the\nalignment of such works with the objective of the work (Section 4).\nAfter selecting the works, they were analyzed (Section 3.1) and\ncompared (Section 3.2), seeking to identify research opportunities.\n3.1\nAnalysis of Related Works\nPorto et al. (2021) [4]. This work performed a systematic map-\nping with the objective of characterizing how gamification has\nbeen adopted in noneducational contexts of software engineering\nactivities. The main results of this study show that gamification\nprovided benefits for activities such as requirements specification,\ndevelopment, testing, project management, and support process.\nIn addition, he pointed out that the number of publications and\nnew research initiatives has increased over the years, many posi-\ntive results have been achieved in software engineering activities.\nNevertheless, the study reinforced that gamification can still be\nexplored for other tasks in this area, as empirical evidence is very\nlimited.\nMarin (2021) [17]. It performed the application of gamification\non some topics of a software engineering course to engage students\nand increase their motivation and argued that, with due motiva-\ntion, students can better exercise the topics and obtain more solid\nknowledge. There were five games related to risk management,\nBPMN modeling, Scrum process, design and inspection of class\ndiagrams, and cosmic functional size measurement to assist in the\nlearning process of the software engineering course. This study also\npresented the lessons learned about the application of gamification\nand serious games in software engineering, including limitations\nor disadvantages.\nJurgelaitis et al. (2018) [12]. This work conducted a research to\ninvestigate how gamification could be inserted into an Information\nSystems Modeling course, which covers a range of topics on UML.\nAs a result, an implementation of the gamified system modeling\ncourse in the Moodle environment was presented, using additional\n101\nModelGame: A Quality Model for Gamified Software Modeling Learning\nSBCARS \u201921, September 27-October 1, 2021, Joinville, Brazil\nplugins for the use of the necessary gamified elements. The study\nshowed good results and obtained a positive acceptance by the\nparticipating students.\nRodrigues et al. (2018) [22]. They investigated the use of games\nand game elements in software engineering education, through a\nresearch that had the participation of 88 instructors of this disci-\npline. The results showed that most instructors are aware of these\neducational approaches, however, the games were adopted by only\n21 participants and game elements were adopted only by 19. Games\nare most often used to cover \u201cSoftware Process\u201d and \u201cProject Man-\nagement\u201d. The most commonly used game elements are points,\nquizzes, and challenges. The results also show that the main rea-\nsons for not adopting the resources are the lack of knowledge,\ninformation about games relevant to the engineering of teaching\nsoftware, and the lack of time to plan and include these approaches\nin the classroom.\nCosentino et al. (2017) [3]. They present a model-based ap-\nproach to learning modeling in a gamified way. The approach in-\ncludes a new language to model the gamification process itself and\nan environment where it can be incorporated into current mod-\neling tools to allow instructors and students to design and use a\ncomplete modeling framework, including gamification elements. In\naddition, the approach also had as a proposal to provide support to\ncollect and analyze gamification data, thus facilitating monitoring\nactivities.\nYohannis (2016) [25]. This research presents an exploration of\ngame design as an approach to strengthening the student\u2019s mas-\ntery in software modeling by developing their abstraction skills. It\nbrought together concepts of gamification development, such as the\nlens of atoms of intrinsic skill and principles of pedagogical design\nof various theories and models of learning. The research follows\nthe Design Science Research Methodology and explores the best\npractices of Model Oriented Engineering. As a result, a modeling\ngame design framework and generation structure and a series of\nproduced games are presented.\nPedreira et al. (2015) [21]. They developed a systematic map-\nping of gamification in Software Engineering based on 29 studies.\nThe mapping revealed that software implementation is the area\nin which most studies focus, followed by software requirements,\nfew others in different areas, such as project planning and software\ntesting, and even to a lesser extent in activities involving software\nmodeling. However, the highlight of this work was to highlight that\ngamification in software engineering is still at a very early stage\nand the evidence on its impact in this field remains inconclusive.\n3.2\nComparative Analysis and Opportunities\nFive Comparison Criteria (CC) were defined selecting the most rele-\nvant variables to assist in the process of identifying similarities and\ndifferences between the proposed work and the selected articles.\nThis comparison is crucial to make the process of identifying re-\nsearch opportunities using objective rather than subjective criteria.\nThe criteria are described below:\n\u2022 Context (CC01): Works that explore the use of gamification\nin software modeling teaching/learning.\n\u2022 Participant profile (CC02): Studies that collected data from\nparticipants for screening and profile characterization.\n\u2022 Applicability of Gamification in UML (CC03): Studies\nthat evaluated how gamification can contribute to UML mod-\nels.\n\u2022 Model creation (CC04): Studies that have developed a model\nto improve factors that imply the non-adoption of UML.\n\u2022 Instructor participation (CC05): Studies that collected\nqualitative data through the participation of software mod-\neling instructors.\nTable 1 shows the comparison of the selected works, confronting\nthis work. Some gaps and research opportunities are observed: (1)\nonly the proposed work was the only one to fully meet all compar-\nison criteria; (2) although most of them targeted the application\nof gamification in software modeling teaching, they were not di-\nrected to the use of UML; (3) no study has developed a model to\nevaluate the learning and improvement of UML models developed\nby students; and (4) most of them did not have the participation\nof instructors to identify the difficulties and opportunities in the\napplication of gamification in the teaching of software modeling.\nThus, the next Section presents a quality model to explore these\nidentified opportunities.\nRelated Work\nComparison Criterion\nCC1\nCC2\nCC3\nCC4\nCC5\nProposed Work\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\nPorto et al (2021) [4]\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\nMarin (2021) [17]\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\nJurgelaitis et al (2018) [12]\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\nRodrigues et al (2018) [22]\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\nCosentino et al (2017) [3]\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\nYohannis (2016) [25]\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\nPedreira et al (2015) [21]\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd Completely Meets\n\ufffd Partially Meets\n\ufffd Does not attend\nTable 1: Comparative analysis of the selected related works\n4\nPROPOSED QUALITY MODEL\nThis section presents the proposed quality model to support soft-\nware modeling learning in a gamified way. It serves as a frame\nof reference so that instructors can evaluate the UML models cre-\nated by students through gamified activities. Section 4.1 presents\na proposal of a generic analytical framework. Section 4.2 details\nthe abstract syntax of the proposed quality model. Section 4.3 ex-\nplains the quality notions related to the gamified software modeling\nlearning.\n4.1\nGeneric Analytical Framework\nFigure 1 presents the generic analytical framework for improving\nthe quality of the models and serves as the basis for the creation of\nan evaluation scheme. The arrows (\"links\"), labeled as Evaluation\nand Gamified Modeling, represent the questions that the evidence\nmust answer; dotted lines represent associations; rectangles rep-\nresent the Models (rounded corners) or the quality states (square\ncorners) by which these bindings are measured. Ellipses represent\nthe adverse effects that can be generated from the evaluation and\nuse of gamification.\nThe numbers refer to the key questions and are connected with\nthe concepts and relationships of the abstract syntax of the Quality\n102\nSBCARS \u201921, September 27-October 1, 2021, Joinville, Brazil\nEd Wilson J\u00fanior and Kleinner Farias\nFigure 1: Generic analytical framework for gamified software modeling learning.\nModel (presented in Section 4.2), as follows: (1) Are there tools\nthat assist instructors in evaluating the models developed by stu-\ndents, thus reducing the poor quality and incompleteness of these\nartifacts? (2) What is the prevalence of characteristics that cause\nmodels to be at risk? (3) Are there notions of quality to evaluate\nthe models as a way to define parameters when performing their\ncorrection? (4) Applying the use of gamification in models that\nneed intervention would be a way to identify factors that could\ngenerate models with high quality levels? (5) Does the application\nof gamification improve the quality of the model? (5.a) How are the\nmodels without gamification evaluated in relation to those with\ngamification? (5.b) Are there reasons to expect that gamification\nmodels can have better quality results than those that are gener-\nated without gamification? (6) Is the output model really effective\nwhen associated with reducing the poor quality of the model? (7)\nDoes the absence of evaluation result in adverse effects? (7.a) is the\nevaluation acceptable for the model? (7.b) What are the potential\nharms, and how often do they occur? (8) Does gamification result\nin adverse effects on models?\nFact is that it is not enough just to include this \"toolbox\" in the\nUML learning process, it is necessary to provide the instructor with\na model (guide) that can serve as a reference to evaluate the quality\nof diagrams elaborated through gamified activities. For example,\nthe instructor could create models predefining inconsistencies by\nmaking use of these questions raised to evaluate the models created\nby the students. The set of questions serves as the starting point for\nthis evaluation. Knowing that the adaptation of the gamification\napproach requires a significant effort [20], in this study we present\nThe ModelGame as a way to identify factors that contribute to\nthe quality of these artifacts and, consequently, to the students\u2019\nlearning.\n4.2\nAbstract Syntax\nFollowing the specification pattern of the UML metamodel, Figure 2\npresents the abstract syntax of the proposed Quality Model for\ngamified software modeling learning (ModelGame). It identifies\nthe main concepts and relationships. The numbers represent the\nnotions of quality that are discussed in Section 4.3. The following\nare detailed each of these concepts and relationships.\nDomain. The first concept presented in this study is the domain,\nwhich corresponds to a specific context of the application to be\ndeveloped to solve the problem. In this process, the design template\nrepresents the solution given to the domain.\nAssociation\n\u2022 contextualizes: Challenges[*]\nEach contextualise refers to the domain that will serve as the\nbasis for the challenges launched.\nChallenges. This concept represents the phase in which the\nproblem is contextualized (domain-based), as well as what will be\nthe missions, phases, scenarios, and other elements presented to\nthe players, in this case the students, who must use the principles\nof software engineering to perform the modeling and reach the\nfinal goal.\nAssociation\n\u2022 influences: Design Model[*]\nEach influence represents that the proposed challenge interfered\nin aspects of the design model, causing the user to seek to make a\ncontinuous improvement.\nModeling Language. Software modeling is an important step\nfor development to happen in a way that adheres to the require-\nments established by the requester, for this, there is the modeling\nlanguage, which offers a standardized way to document and design\nsoftware. Through the use of modeling languages, it is possible to\nachieve a high level of understanding about the software in ques-\ntion, improving the communication between all those involved in\nthe process, thus avoiding implementation errors. It points out that\nsoftware engineers use these languages to communicate design\ndecisions and verify the feasibility of implementing the intended\ndesign. The UML was consolidated as the Modeling Language in\nthe paradigm of object orientation, in which it is possible through\nvisual notation generated from the diagrams- presented later in this\nstudy as Design Models- to perform the representation of various\nperspectives of the system.\nAssociation\n103\nModelGame: A Quality Model for Gamified Software Modeling Learning\nSBCARS \u201921, September 27-October 1, 2021, Joinville, Brazil\nFigure 2: Abstract Quality Model Syntax.\n\u2022 expresses: Design Model[*]\nPerforms the representation of the intended design templates, in\nwhich the Modeling Language should be applicable to the domain\ntype.\nUser. This concept corresponds to the individual who performs\nthe interpretation of the developed design models, whose objective\nis to be able to understand the domain in question. In the gamified\ncontext, the user has the role of player and it is he who performs\nthe whole process, being able to perform the interpretation of ex-\nisting models or even creating new ones. The user can also identify\nand resolve inconsistencies that arise from compositions between\nmodels.\nAssociation\n\u2022 creates: Design Model[1..*]\nRepresents the process in which the user creates a design template,\nwhich can be one or more.\n\u2022 interprets: Design Model[1..*]\nIn this association, the user performs the interpretation of the design\ntemplate. When interpreting the model, paths for the resolution of\ninconsistencies can be identified.\n\u2022 detects: Inconsistency [*]\nRepresents the user\u2019s discovery of design model inconsistencies,\nfor example, those that are generated from identifying conflicts,\nwhether a class is abstract or not.\n\u2022 resolves: Inconsistency [*]\nEach resolves equates to the resolution representation of the incon-\nsistencies by the user that happens after he analyzes and determines\nthe best alternative to perform this action.\n\u2022 uses: Modeling Tools [*]\nDetermines that the user can use modeling tools to generate/update\ndesign models.\nAssociation\n\u2022 Without a directed relationship.\nModeling Tool. This concept represents the applications that\nare used to carry out the construction of design models. There are\nseveral tools available, online and desktop, and it is up to the user\nto choose the one that will best meet their needs and adapt to the\ncontext in question, that is, they work in any domain that is being\nconsidered.\nDesign Model. The design model refers to a visual notation\n(diagram) to represent static and dynamic aspects. These models are\nbuilt according to a specific objective or task and tend to facilitate\nthe logical interpretation of the software in several aspects. The\nmost popular diagrams are Use Cases and Classes, the first being\nstatic and representing a set of actions generated from functional\nrequirements (use cases) and presenting the interactions generated\nwith external users (actors). The second is a static diagram and\nmakes the representation of the logical structure of the software\ninvolving the classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships\nbetween them [19].\nAssociation\n\u2022 describes: Domain[1]\nEach describes makes the representation of a specific domain\nand means that every design model must describe it.\nInconsistency. It corresponds to the defects found in the models\ndeveloped by users. They may occur because of the nonidentifi-\ncation and correction of possible conflicts and even an erroneous\ninterpretation.\nAssociation\n\u2022 affects: Design Model[*]\nThis association indicates that with each occurrence of the affect, a\nproblem is presented harming the quality of the design model.\n104\nSBCARS \u201921, September 27-October 1, 2021, Joinville, Brazil\nEd Wilson J\u00fanior and Kleinner Farias\nPoints. This concept represents one of the most used game me-\nchanics in software engineering and functions as a quantitative\nreward for each action developed, in which it is possible to regulate\nthe number of rewarded points of the player, defined here as user,\nbased on the importance of each action. Through this concept, it\nis possible to stimulate competition, collaboration, and creativity\namong users, stimulating learning. Points appear as a derivation\nof the association affects, since when each inconsistency error is\nidentified or not, the user will receive a score and the association\ndescribes, because the points will also be applied when making\nconnections between the model and the domain.\nProgress. The concept of progress emerges as a factor that makes\nthe user able to perceive its evolution in the process, in this case,\nsoftware modeling. Progress emerges as a derivation of the associa-\ntion interprets, making the user know when they have performed\na correct interpretation of the proposed design model or what still\nneeds to be improved.\nFeedback. Feedback has the role of making the user realize that\nthe proposed goal can be achieved and follow its evolution, includ-\ning analyzing how to change or creating new strategies to achieve\nthe goal. This concept emerges as a derivation between the associa-\ntions it creates, causing the user to receive a return to the model\ncreation process.\n4.3\nQuality Notions\nAs discussed in Section 2, gamification can bring important ele-\nments for learning software modeling and, therefore, the objective\nof this section is to produce the notions of quality of the model\nof this study. The ModelGame is composed of ten counts, four of\nwhich are proposed in this study - scope, use, motivational and en-\ngagement - extracted from the main benefits that the gamification\nelements presented in Figure 2 can bring to the models. The others\nare adaptations of previous works [6, 14, 15], they are, syntactic,\nsemantic, social, effort, detection and resolution.\nScope Quality (1). It seeks to determine how much the proposed\nchallenge is contextualized with the design model, as well as the def-\ninition of the domain, problem, competencies, concepts, behaviors\nand attitudes that will be developed throughout the process.\nSyntactic Quality (2). This notion makes the representation of\nthe process of correction of the design models that are produced\nby the modeling language, because if it is not used correctly, incon-\nsistencies will arise. It is important to insert this notion of quality\ninto our study, since during the process of developing the models,\nusers may come across the composition of two class diagrams, for\nexample.\nSemantic Quality (3). It is necessary to verify that the design\nmodel and the problem domain match, so this notion performs\nthis type of analysis. Communication problems may occur between\nusers if the semantic elements of the model are affected.\nSocial Quality (4). Design models are used to communicate\nbetween members of a team to inform all established decisions\nabout software development [8]. If divergent interpretations occur,\nthis communication will be greatly impaired.\nQuality of Effort (5). This notion refers to the production chal-\nlenges of the model that will be generated, including factors such\nas time and cost.\nQuality of Use (6). To produce design templates, users can use\nunusual tools such as paper, whiteboard, and more. However, most\nof the time they choose to use formal tools (CASES) and can be\nonline or desktop. This notion corresponds to the level of ease and\napplicability of the models elaborated when making use of these\ntools, it is also important to contribute to communication between\nusers through collaboration-related functionalities.\nDetection Quality (7). This notion is referenced to the process\nof locating inconsistencies, since when users arise, they should\nperform traceability of them quickly. If the detection is complicated,\nit could hinder the process of correcting the models.\nResolution Quality (8). It corresponds to the level of quality\nrelated to the effort that users take to look for alternatives to solve\nthe identified problem.\nMotivational Quality (9). This notion refers to the motiva-\ntional factors involved during the learning and development of\ndesign models, which can be intrinsic and extrinsic. Elements of\ngamification such as points, feedback and progress bring the user a\ndegree of satisfaction in continuing their discovery and transfor-\nmations throughout the process.\nQuality of Engagement (10). The user in tracking their progress\ncan feel committed to the objective in question, and this notion\nrepresents the measurement of the level of commitment of them\nduring the development of design models.\n5\nEVALUATION\nThis section describes the methodology followed to evaluate the\nproposed quality model. This methodology follows well-established\nempirical guidelines [24]. Section 5.1 details the objective and re-\nsearch questions (RQ). Section 5.2 presents the questionnaire formu-\nlated to evaluate the proposed quality model. Section 5.3 explains\nthe context and selection of participants. Section 5.4 describes the\npresentation of the Model. Section 5.5 presents the analysis of the\ncollected data.\n5.1\nObjective and Research Questions\nThe objective (O) of this study is twofold: (O1) Introduce Model-\nGame as a tool for teaching Software Modeling; and (O2) Analyze\nthe applicability of the quality model regarding the improvement\nof UML models.\nTo analyze the different facets of the objectives, two Research\nQuestions (RQ) have been formulated:\n\u2022 RQ1: How do instructors evaluate the use of gamification\nin software modeling?\n\u2022 RQ2: What is the acceptance of ModelGame by software\nmodeling instructors?\n5.2\nQuestionnaire\nData was collected through an online questionnaire created through\nGoogle Forms1 following well-established guidelines described in\n[24]. This strategy was chosen because the questionnaire could\nbe applied quickly and easily collect data from individuals in geo-\ngraphically diverse locations. The questions of the questionnaire\n1Questionnaire: https://forms.gle/qjaFDpErEtGdLuWw6\n105\nModelGame: A Quality Model for Gamified Software Modeling Learning\nSBCARS \u201921, September 27-October 1, 2021, Joinville, Brazil\nwere concerned with examining the research gaps of previous stud-\nies and apprehending the structures of the previously developed\nquestionnaire.\nPart 1: Participant profile. The first part of the questionnaire\nconsisted of collecting data that are related to the characteristics\nand opinions of the participants. The creation of the participant\nprofile through this data is important to make the selection of\npossible users of ModelGame. Without this profile, participants\nwith an inadequate profile may generate inconsistent assessments.\nParticipants were asked to provide more general information, such\nas age, education level, academic background. Information about\nthe time of experience in teaching was also considered, including\nteaching software modeling and level of knowledge about UML\nmodels.\nPart 2: TAM questionnaire. The second part addressed ques-\ntions about the usability and acceptance of the technique, aiming\nto explore q3. To this end, this part of our questionnaire is based on\nthe technology acceptance model (TAM) [16]. This part contained\nnine questions, which were answered through the Likert Scale, in-\ncluding Totally Agree, Partially Agree, Neutral, Partially Disagree,\nand Totally Disagree. The questions formulated (Q) dealt with sev-\neral topics, including perceived ease of use (Q1-3), perceived utility\n(Q4-7), attitude towards use (Q8), and behavioral intention to use\n(Q9).\n5.3\nSelection of participants\nThe participants were selected based on the following criteria: in-\nstructors and/or professionals working in the teaching of software\nmodeling in higher education institutions in Brazil. Using this cri-\nterion, we sought to select participants with academic training\nand practical experience in teaching. This finite set of all possible\nparticipants represents the target population [13]. This popula-\ntion represents those people who are in a position to answer the\nquestions formulated and to whom the results of the survey apply\n[13]. In all, 19 people (n) answered the questionnaire. The partici-\npants were invited via e-mail to participate in the study and each\nof them previously received the explanation/training about the\nmodel proposed through the researcher and there was no doubt,\nthey could leave for the next step that consisted of completing the\nTAM questionnaire. We discussed the experimental process in the\nnext section.\n5.4\nExperimental Process\nFigure 3 presents the experimental process used in this study, which\nis composed of three phases discussed below:\nPhase 1: Presentation. It has an activity, presentation, in which\nthe researcher explained to the participants through a video detail\nabout the quality model. This process took place individually and\nin a standard way, where space was also made available for par-\nticipants to answer possible doubts about the proposed study and\nmodel, lasting an average of 20 minutes.\nPhase 2: Application of the TAM questionnaire. It has two\nactivities, the first being Collect demographic data. The participants\nanswered a list of questions (input) so that we could collect their\ncharacteristics and opinions about the ModelGame. The demo-\ngraphic data collected (output) became the result of this activity.\nThe second activity Apply TAM questionnaire (input). Participants\nreceived a list of questions about the perception of ease of use, per-\nceived utility, attitudes, and intention of behavior, in relation to the\nModelGame. Qualitative data (output) were generated, regarding\nthe usability and acceptance of the Model under the perspective\nof professionals who teach software modeling. This questionnaire\nfollowed the guidelines of the TAM [16].\nPhase 3: Analysis and result report. It has two activities. The\nfirst, Analyze data sought to perform a thorough analysis of the data\ncollected through the questionnaire and the researcher\u2019s perception\nregarding the participants\u2019 doubts during the presentation stage.\nFor this, the collected data were analyzed separately, as well as con-\nfronted, aiming to perform a triangulation of them. Subsequently,\nthere was an Evaluation data, as a way to understand in a more\ndepth the context, the perceptions of the participants in relation to\nthe proposed model as well as its applicability.\nFigure 3: The experimental process.\n5.5\nResult Analysis\n5.5.1\nProfile data of the participants. Table 3 describes the profile\ndata, reporting the characteristics and opinions of the participants.\nThese data were collected from May 18 to June 5, 2021. In total,\nwe had 19 participants. Our participants are between 20 and 49\nyears old, most of them have a degree in Computer Science (52.6%),\nInformation Systems (26.3%) or Systems Analysis (21.1%) and are\nspecialists (36.8%), masters (36.8%) and doctors (15.8%). About the\nworking time in teaching, the majority (42.1%) they have been teach-\ning for more than 8 years and teach disciplines related to software\nmodeling, including software engineering, systems analysis and\nsoftware projects. A total of 47.4% have a full level of knowledge\nabout UML and almost half of them (47.4%) has not yet used gamifi-\ncation in the teaching of software modeling. Therefore, we consider\n106\nSBCARS \u201921, September 27-October 1, 2021, Joinville, Brazil\nEd Wilson J\u00fanior and Kleinner Farias\nTotally agree\nPartially agree\nNeutral\nPartially disagree\nTotally disagree\nPerceived ease of use\nI found the quality model easy to use\n8\n9\n2\n0\n0\nI found the quality model easy to learn\n10\n9\n0\n0\n0\nI found the quality model easy to master\n6\n12\n0\n1\n0\nPerceived usefulness\nThe model would make it easier to understand which elements of gamification can be used in modeling .\n12\n5\n2\n0\n0\nUsing the quality model would help increase productivity.\n9\n8\n2\n0\n0\nThe model would provide an understanding of how to mitigate the incompleteness of UML diagrams.\n5\n8\n5\n1\n0\nThe model would help compare theories about gamification in software modeling teaching.\n13\n4\n2\nAttitude towards use\nUsing the Quality Model for Gamified Software Modeling Learning is a good idea.\n13\n5\n1\n0\n0\nBehavioral intention to use\nI would use the quality model in software modeling classes.\n10\n7\n2\n0\n0\nTable 2: Collected data related to TAM questionnaire.\nthat although small, our sample is adequate to carry out an initial\nevaluation of the proposed approach.\nCharacteristic and Opinion (n=19)\nAnswer\n#\n%\nAge\n< 20 years\n0\n0.0%\n20-29 years\n4\n21.1%\n30-39 years\n8\n42.1%\n40-49 years\n5\n26.3%\n> 49 years\n2\n10.5%\nEducation\nUndergraduate*\n0\n0.0%\nSpecialization*\n7\n36.8%\nMaster*\n7\n36.8%\nPhD*\n3\n15.8%\nOthers\n2\n10.6%\nUndergraduate course\nInformation Systems\n5\n26.3%\nComputer Science\n10\n52.6%\nComputer Engineering\n0\n0.0%\nSystem Analysis\n4\n21,1%\nOthers\n0\n0.0%\nTime of experience in teaching\n< 2 years\n4\n21.1%\n2-4 years\n2\n10.5%\n5-6 years\n3\n15.8%\n7-8 years\n2\n10.5%\n> 8 years\n8\n42.1%\nExperience in teaching\n< 2 years\n3\n15.8%\nsoftware modeling\n2-4 years\n5\n26.3%\n5-6 years\n3\n15.8%\n7-8 years\n2\n10.5%\n> 8 years\n6\n31,6%\nLevel of knowledge\nBeginner\n2\n10.5%\nabout UML models\nJunior\n5\n26.3%\nFull\n9\n47.4%\nSenior\n3\n15.8%\nUsed gamification in teaching\nYes\n9\n47.4%\nNo\n9\n47,4%\nMaybe\n1\n5.3%\nGamification can contribute to the quality\nTotally agree\n10\n52.6%\nof the models of UML diagrams generated\nPartially agree\n8\n42.1%\nby students\nNeutral\n1\n5.3%\nPartially disagree\n0\n0.0%\nTotally disagree\n0\n0.0%\nTable 3: The profile data of the participants.\n5.5.2\nRQ1: How do instructors evaluate the use of gamification in\nsoftware modeling? Table 3 presents the collected data related to\nthe RQ formulated. First, we begin the analysis by verifying how\ninstructors visualize gamification in software modeling teaching.\nAlthough most of them (47.4%) have not yet used gamification\nelements (scores, challenge, emblem, among others) in their classes,\nmost (52.6%) totally agree and (42.1%) partially agree that the use\nof these can contribute to the quality of the models developed by\nthe students.\nWe consider the percentage of instructors who have not yet\nused gamification in their classes to be high and this may be tied\nto factors such as lack of knowledge, information about the tool,\nand even time to plan and include these approaches [22]. Although\nthey were based on software modeling teaching context, previous\nstudies [3, 4, 12, 17, 25] they did not count on the participation of\ninstructors and we understand that this participation is fundamental\nto understand the perceptions of these professionals since they will\nbe at the forefront of the use of gamification.\nThe ModelGame proposed in this study could help them insert\ngamification into their classes, according to the software modeling\nlearning design [25], based on the assumption that for this, it is\nnecessary to develop a better understanding of the tasks, activities,\nskills and operations that the different elements of gamification can\noffer and how they can correspond to the desired learning outcomes\nby developing a more concrete and motivating presentation that\ncan involve students and facilitate deep learning with UML.\n5.5.3\nRQ2: What is the acceptance of the ModelGame by software\nmodeling instructors? Using the TAM questionnaire, we tried to\nevaluate the ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude, and behav-\nioral intention to use the Quality Model. Table 2 shows the data\nobtained. Our data obtained show that no one disagreed that the\nModelGame is easy to use, learn, and master. On the contrary, al-\nmost 90% of participants find the model easy to use (42.1% totally\nagree and 47.4% partially agrees and 10.5% neutral), learn (52.6%\n107\nModelGame: A Quality Model for Gamified Software Modeling Learning\nSBCARS \u201921, September 27-October 1, 2021, Joinville, Brazil\nfully agree and 47.4% partially agree) and master (31.6% fully agree,\n63.2% partially agree and 5.3% partially disagree).\nThe results are also favorable considering the perception of util-\nity. Most participants realized that the ModelGame would make it\neasier to understand which elements of gamification can be used in\neach of the phases of modeling using UML(63.3% totally agree, 26.3%\npartially agree and 10.5% neutral), increase productivity (47.4% fully\nagree, 42.1% partially agree and 10.5% neutral), and the use of the\nquality model would provide an understanding of how to mitigate\nthe incompleteness of UML diagrams (26.3% agree totalmen 42.1%\npartially agree, 26.3% neutral and 5.3% partially disagree). Still in\nthe useful aspect, we tried to know if the quality model would help\nto compare validated theories about the inclusion of gamification\nin software modeling teaching (68.4% totally agree, 21.1% partially\nagree and 10.5% neutral).\nConsidering the attitude towards use, participants believe that\nusing the ModelGame is a good idea (68.4% totally agree, 26.3%\npartially agree and 5.3% neutral), just as they are confident and\nwould use the Model in software modeling classes (52.6% totally\nagree, 36.8% partially agree and 10.5% neutral). These findings show\nthe potential for acceptance by people with profiles similar to those\nof participants. The results are encouraging and show the potential\nto use the proposed approach in the educational scenario.\n6\nTHREATS TO VALIDITY\nThis section discusses the possible threats to the validity of the\nstudy.\nInternal validity. The main point affecting the internal validity\nof our study concerns the total time used for the exploratory phase.\nTo mitigate this threat, we performed the video recording of a pilot\nexplaining the operating details and objectives of the ModelGame.\nIn relation to the methods used, the threats related to internal\nvalidity relate to how we extract the perceptions of the discussions\nand whether they represent the perceptions of teachers about the\nuse of the Model. We try to reduce this threat by applying the TAM\nquestionnaire.\nExternal validity. We identified threats related to external va-\nlidity, such as the number of participants who never applied the use\nof gamification. This study was limited to 19 participants (teachers)\nfrom various educational institutions, of which 9 (47.4%) never used\nany element of gamification in their classes, this factor can interfere\nin the data, since the model intends to evaluate the quality of UML\ndiagrams from gamified activities.\nConclusion validity. Threats related to the validity of the con-\nclusion are related to treatment and outcome. We try to make the\nreduction by combining quantitative and qualitative data through\ndifferent resources. These data were obtained through audio and\nquestionnaires. We analyze this data to answer the research ques-\ntions.\n7\nCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\nThis study proposed an initial quality model (ModelGame) that\nserves as a reference framework for instructors for qualitative eval-\nuations of UML models developed from gamified activities, the\napplication of an empirical study with 19 participants was carried\nout to understand their vision in relation to gamification and the\nacceptance of the proposed Model. It was identified that most have\nnot yet used gamification in their classes, but agree that their use\ncan contribute to the quality of the models developed by the stu-\ndents and were open to using the model. Our findings can enhance\nthe adoption of new teaching practices through gamification, result-\ning in the improvement of software modeling learning using UML,\nand consequently the creation of models developed by students.\nThese approaches can stimulate students\u2019 immersion in the design\nof systems as future professionals during learning.\nFinally, we hope to carry out in the future a series of experimental\nstudies to analyze each stage of application of the ModelGame\nand that this work represents a first step to better support the\napplication of empirical studies on models of evaluation of the\nuse of gamification in software modeling. We also hope that the\nquestions described throughout the article will encourage other\nresearchers to extend our study to different modeling languages\nand teaching methodologies.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Rick Adcock, Edward Alef, Bruce Amato, Mark Ardis, Larry Bernstein, Barry\nBoehm, Pierre Bourque, John Brackett, Murray Cantor, Lillian Cassel, et al. 2009.\nCurriculum guidelines for graduate degree programs in software engineering.

Software projects\nconducted by students simulating real scale software development\nmay help enhance students\u2019 motivation, although it requires a lot of\nefforts to prepare such projects and manage them.\nAnother way of solving this problem is to teach those who al-\nready have real experience in industry. In our case, there are cur-\nrently \ufb01ve Ph. D. students under the author\u2019s supervision who are\nworking at companies as well as doing research in our lab. As\na by-product, interactions between the part-time students and the\nother regular students stimulate each other, particularly enlighten-\ning the regular students to practical software issues. However, too\nmuch emphasis on practicality may bring negligence to scienceand\nCopyright is held by the author/owner.\nICSE\u201905, May 15\u201321, 2005, St. Louis, Missouri, USA.\nACM 1-58113-963-2/05/0005.\ntechnology and may generate anti-intellectualism. A good balance\nbetween the scienti\ufb01c aspect and the practical aspect of software\nengineering should always be pursued.\nIn our view, teaching various software modeling techniques is a\ngood way to achieve balanced software engineering education. It\nis needless to say that model is a key concept and modeling is an\nessential skill in software engineering. There are a variety of mod-\neling techniques; some are intuitive and quite accessibleto novices,\nwhile some are highly sophisticated and attract theory oriented stu-\ndents and researchers.\nIn this paper, we would like to show that it is effective to teach\nmultiple modeling techniques from a uni\ufb01ed viewpoint. It is based\non our experience of teaching software engineering courses at sev-\neral universities in Japan. Recently, the author published a textbook\non software engineering, speci\ufb01cally focused on software model-\ning (unfortunately, it is written in Japanese)[1]. The book covers\nthe whole area of software engineering, including design, testing\nand evolution but the modeling part has a role of attracting inter-\nests of intelligent students, who may not have much experience in\ndeveloping real scale software systems. It also gives a consistent\nviewpoint penetrating through various techniques employed in dif-\nferent stages of software engineering.\n2.\nMODELING TECHNIQUES\nIn software engineering, models are used for various purposes,\ne.g. life cycle model, process model, project model, product model,\nquality model, domain model, requirements model, design model,\nobject model, data model, etc. In the following, we basically focus\non requirements and design models but most of the discussionswill\nhold for other kinds of models.\nTeaching modeling is almost equal to teaching abstraction. Mod-\nels are constructed through capturing the crucial properties and\nstructure of the target, abstracting away irrelevant details. Thus,\nlearning how to model is a good training for mastering abstraction.\n2.1\nGraph Representation of Models\nMany software models are represented with diagrams. Wide ac-\nceptance of UML symbolizes the trend that diagrams are often pre-\nferred to textual languages. Among many types of diagrams, graph\nstructured diagrams are by far the most widely used. The reasons\nmay be as follows.\n1. A most fundamental way for human mind to understand the\nworld is by regarding it as consisting of a set of conceptual\nunits and a set of relations between them. Conceptual units\ncan be naturally illustrated with boxes or circles or whatever\nclosed \ufb01gures and relations can be illustrated with lines or ar-\nrows connecting such \ufb01gures, corresponding to vertices and\nedges of graphs, respectively.\n609\n2. It is easy to draw graph structured diagrams by hand or with\ndrawing tools.\n3. Concepts and algorithms of the graph theory are available\nand often useful in analyzing models represented by graphs.\nA typical example is reasoning on transitive relations by trac-\ning along paths of graphs. Also, the concept of subgraph is\nhighly useful in decomposinghigher-level models or cluster-\ning lower-level models.\nAccordingly, a number of models share the same structure of\ngraphs. Table 1 shows graph structures of some typical models.\nTable 1: Graph structures of typical models\nmodel\nvertex\nedge\nData \ufb02ow\nprocess\ndata \ufb02ow\nER\nentity\nrelationship\nState transition\nstate\ntransition\nJSD\nprocess\ndata stream connection\nstate vector connection\nActivity\nactivity\ncontrol \ufb02ow\nPetri net\nplace, transition\n\ufb01re and token \ufb02ow\n2.2\nCommonality and Difference between\nModels\nIt is pedagogical to let students notice the common structure\nshared by a number of models. However, the apparent resemblance\noften causes confusion. Such confusion can be observed not only\nin software modeling graphs but in many diagrams found in daily\nnewspapers, magazines, reports, proposals and other documents. It\nis often the case that one vertex denotes a type of things and an-\nother denotes quite a different type on the same diagram or one\ntype of edges co-exist with edges with different meaning. Thus,\nit is important to make students consciously aware the differences\nbetween different models. We often experience that when we let\nstudents draw data \ufb02ow diagrams who appear to have understood\nthe data \ufb02ow model perfectly, the diagrams turn out to be some-\nthing like control \ufb02ow graphs.\nTo show the difference, it is instructive to categorize models rep-\nresented by graphs. Basically, there are two categories.\n1. Static models:\nAn edge connecting vertex A and vertex B represents a rela-\ntion between A and B. When the edge is undirected, it means\n\u201cA and B are in some relation\u201d and when directed, it means\n\u201cA has a relation with B\u201d. Typical examples include entity\nrelationship model, class diagram and semantic network.\n2. Dynamic models:\nAn edge from vertex A to B denotes a move from A to B.\nThe edge in this case is always directed. There are two sub-\ncategories:\n(a) The case where a view of control moves from A to B.\nExamples are control \ufb02ow model and state transition\nmodel.\n(b) The case where data or objects \ufb02ow from A to B. Exam-\nples are data \ufb02ow model, work \ufb02ow model, and trans-\nportation \ufb02ow model.\nStatic models and dynamic models may not be easily confused\nbut confusion betweendifferent dynamic models are often observed,\ne.g. data \ufb02ow and control \ufb02ow or state transition and activity tran-\nsition. Since graphs are intuitively understandable, their semantics\nare apt to be understood ambiguously or misunderstood.\n3.\nUML\nUML diagrams can also be viewed in terms of graph structures.\nTable 2 shows graph structures of \ufb01ve UML diagrams.\nTable 2: Graph structures of UML diagrams\ndiagram\nvertex\nedge\nclass diagram\nclass\ngeneralization,\ncomposition,\nassociation\nstate machine\nstate\ntransition\nactivity diagram\nactivity\ncontrol \ufb02ow\ncollaboration diagram\nobject\nmessage \ufb02ow\nsequence diagram\nmessage\nmessage \ufb02ow\nanchor point\nIt is usually not desirable to teach UML per se. UML is a col-\nlection of miscellaneous diagrams and its speci\ufb01cation is continu-\nously changing. For the pedagogical purpose, UML had better be\nregarded as a catalogue of analysis and design know-how collected\naround diagrammatic representations. Diagrams should be selected\naccording to the policy of how to teach modeling methods.\nEach UML diagram contains overly rich constructs, which some-\ntimes blur the essential property of the model. For example, the\nactivity diagram is essentially a control \ufb02ow diagram but it also in-\ncludes a notation for data \ufb02ow description. From the stance of em-\nphasizing differences between various models, it is not appropriate\nto include such ad hoc constructs. By the same token, the collab-\noration diagram (, renamed to \u201ccommunication diagram\u201d in UML\n2) is explained to have the equivalent semantics as the sequence\ndiagram. But if that is the case, signi\ufb01cance of the collaboration\ndiagram is considerably limited. The author prefers to regard it as\nshowing collaboration relations between objects, integrating a set\nof different sequence diagrams.\n4.\nCONCLUSION\nSoftware modeling is important by itself but teaching modeling\nin the software engineering course has at least two additional mean-\nings. One is to give a bird\u2019s-eye view to the whole software engi-\nneering through the standpoint of modeling technology. The other\nis to attract interest of good students who may not have much expe-\nrience in developing a real-scale software but possess intelligence\nand will to attack complexity of modern software construction.\n5.\nREFERENCES\n[1] T.

Here we aim to set the foundations of a general frame-\nwork for studying, developing, and conveying quantum programs.\nWe aim to do so by developing a universal modeling language\nfor quantum software. Rather than develop such a language from\nscratch, we have decided to start from the well-known Unified\nModeling Language (UML)[3], and introduce a minimum set of\nextensions that allow it to effectively model quantum software.\nAssuming UML to be a shared common-language upon which\nwe can build, allows us to convey our original extensions much\nmore succinctly. Our extension set can, however, be applied with\nlittle or no modification to any other modeling language.\n2\nQ-UML\nBefore discussing in depth the extensions we are introducing, we\nmake a few fundamental observations on which we base the guiding\nprinciples for our extension set.\nOur first observation is about the nature of quantum computa-\ntion. The central difference between quantum and classical com-\nputation is in how it achieves its goals. Quantum computers have\naccess to quantum algorithms[7], and quantum data-structures[8],\nthat are unavailable to classical computers\u2014hence their perfor-\nmance advantage. Algorithms and data-structures are, however,\nimplementation details. Algorithms are an essential design choice\nwhile programming in the small. However, they are more often\nthan not completely ignored in large-scale software architectural\ndesign. For instance, UML diagrams seldom portray algorithms and\ndata-structures beyond a very high-level design perspective.\nIt would seem then that quantum computation introduces noth-\ning to computation that needs to be captured in a software design\ndiagram. This is not the case, and the reason for this is our second\nobservation. Quantum computation changes the very nature of in-\nformation itself. Quantum information is much richer than classical\ninformation. It is also much more challenging to store, transmit,\nand receive. If a module (class, object, etc.) needs to store, transmit\nor receive quantum information, then this is an important design\nconsideration\u2014which needs to be included in any effective software\ndesign.\nA third observation here is that the classical vs. quantum nature\nof the information used by a module is an important consideration\nboth when discussing its internal implementation and its interface.\nFurthermore, these two are separate and independent considera-\ntions.\nA classical module, implementing some classical behavior, would\nhave no need, or capability, to communicate quantum data. A quan-\ntum module may or may not have to; i.e. a module\u2019s quantum\nbehavior may be completely part of its internal implementation\n442\n2020 IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering Workshops (ICSEW)\nand not appear as part of its interface. For instance, take a module\nimplementing Shor\u2019s algorithm. Shor\u2019s algorithm uses quantum\neffects to efficiently factor a large integer into its prime factors.\nThe implementation of this module must necessarily be quantum.\nBoth the input (the large integer) and the output (the prime factors),\nconsist of classical information. And hence, the interface of such a\nmodule can be strictly classical.\nMore generally, we can conceive of quantum software modules\nthat have all classical inputs and outputs (like the above example),\nall quantum inputs and outputs, or a mix of both. A quantum soft-\nware design must address, for each individual interface element,\nwhether it is classical input/output, or if it is quantum. In short,\nwhether a module communicates classically or via quantum infor-\nmation, and whether its internal implementation requires quantum\nhardware are important considerations that need to be captured in\na design document.\nThe importance of such labelling should be clear. Quantum data\ncan only be stored and transmitted with special hardware designed\nto do so. More importantly, from an abstract, device-independent,\nstrictly software perspective: quantum and classical information\nare not interchangeable. Classical information is clone-able and\nadmits fanout operations, while quantum information (in general)\ndoes not. On the other hand, quantum information has a much\nlarger state-space.\nFinally, it is true that quantum information is strictly a super-set\nof classical information\u2014and hence a quantum module can commu-\nnicate any classical information it desires using a quantum interface\nelement. We argue, however, that using a quantum interface ele-\nment and messaging when classical would suffice is bad quantum\nsoftware design, for the reasons stated above.\nIn summary, the guiding principles behind any quantum software\nmodeling language must include the following:\n(1) (Quantum Classes): Whenever a software module makes\nuse of quantum information, either as part of its internal\nstate/implementation, or as part of its interface, this must be\nclearly established in a design document.\n(2) (Quantum Elements): Each module interface element (e.g.\npublic functions/methods, public variables) and internal state\nvariables can be either classical or quantum, and must be\nlabelled accordingly.\n(a) (Quantum Variables): Each variable should be labelled\nas classical or quantum. If the model represents data types,\nthe variables should also specify the classical (e.g. integer,\nstring) or quantum (e.g. qubit, qubit array, quantum graph\nstate) data type,\n(b) (Quantum Operations): For each operation, both the in-\nput and output should be clearly labelled as either classical\nor quantum. Whether the operation internally operates\nquantumly should also be labelled.\n(3) (Quantum Supremacy): A module that has at least one\nquantum element is to be considered a quantum software\nmodule, otherwise it is a classical module. Quantum and\nclassical modules should be clearly labelled as such.\n(4) (Quantum Aggregation): Any module that is composed of\none or more quantum modules will itself be considered a\nquantum module, and must be labelled as such.\n(5) (Quantum Communication): Quantum and classical mod-\nules can communicate with each other as long as their inter-\nfaces are compatible, i.e. the quantum module has classical\ninputs and/or outputs that can interface with the classical\nmodule.\nWe will argue in Sec. 2.3 how these extensions are not only nec-\nessary, but also sufficient in order to design and represent quantum\nsoftware. First, in the following two sections we put these principles\ninto practice as a set of concrete extensions to UML.\n2.1\nClass Diagram Extensions\nUML is a very graphical language, meant to convey a lot of meaning\nin a very small amount of space. As such, it makes sense to use a\ngraphical way to represent quantum software elements. We chose to\ndo this by use of bold text to denote quantum elements, and double\nlines to denote a quantum relationship or quantum communication.\nFigure 1: Q-UML class diagram of Shor\u2019s Algorithm. Quan-\ntum classes and interface elements are presented in bold\ntext, and quantum relationships use double-lines.\nFor attributes, the name will be bold if it is represented using\nquantum information. For methods, we use the following conven-\ntion. If any of the inputs are quantum, these are bold. If the output\nor datatype of the method is quantum, then the datatype should also\nbe bold. For backwards compatibility with regular UML, whenever\nthe input or output datatypes of a method are omitted, these will be\nassumed to be classical in nature. If a class/object has any quantum\nattributes or methods then it itself is considered quantum, and its\nname shall also be bold.\nRelationships between classes will use double-lines whenever the\nrelationship is quantum in nature. For inheritance, if the superclass\nis quantum then the subclass, and the inheritance relationship, will\nalso be quantum. (the converse is not necessarily true however).\nIn the case of aggregation and composition, if a class/object being\naggregated/composed is quantum, then the class/object to which\nit is aggregated/composed into, as well as that relationship will\n443\nalso be quantum. Association relationships do not have any special\nrules, beyond the need of a quantum class/object to have a classical\ninterface if it is to associate with classical classes/objects.\nFig. 1 showcases a Q-UML diagram that exemplifies the above\nrules.\n2.2\nSequence Diagram Extensions\nSequence diagrams in UML allow us to portray the dynamic rela-\ntionship between modules in a software program. As we did before\nfor static relationships, we extend the existing language in order to\nallow us to differentiate between classical and quantum messages.\nAs previously discussed, this is essential information. Quantum\ninformation behaves differently from classical information; it can\nstore/portray different data; it admits different operations; and, it\nrequires different hardware to store, send, and receive.\nFigure 2: Q-UML sequence diagram of Shor\u2019s Algorithm.\nQuantum classes are presented in bold text, and quantum\nmessages use double-lines.\nLike before, we make use of bold text to markup quantum mod-\nules, and double lines to portray quantum messages. Fig. 2 shows a\nQ-UML sequence diagram. Note how even though the relationship\nbetween Shorfactor and ShorOrder is quantum, the messaging\nbetween them is not. This illustrates an important point. A module\nis marked as quantum if it uses quantum resources in any form,\neither directly as part of its internal implementation or as part of\nan aggregated module. If a sub-module (in UML a composed class\nor object) is quantum, then the encompassing module must also be\nmarked as quantum. In a static (e.g. class) diagram, the quantum\ncomposition relationships inform us\u2014especially in the case of a\nseemingly classical module that does not in itself use quantum\nresources\u2014which composed modules are using quantum resources.\nAlso, note the communication between the objects ShorOrder\nand QFT_n. The module QFT_n operates on a quantum state.\nHence, both \u2018set\u2019 messages are quantum. Likewise, the return mes-\nsages \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 are quantum states. However, the request to perform\na quantum Fourier transform (QFT) or a QFT inverse operation\ncan (and therefore should) be communicated classically. This dia-\ngram showcases the level of granularity available to us using these\ndiagrams with the proposed extensions.\n2.3\nDiscussion\nWe have proposed a minimal series of extensions to existing soft-\nware modeling languages. We exemplify our additions in UML,\nbut these extensions are easily applicable to any other modeling\nlanguage, or be used as the basis for a new modeling language.\nWe\u2019ve argued the necessity of each of the extensions in previous\nsections. We can argue as well, that these extensions are not only\nnecessary, but also sufficient to fully model quantum software.\nTo make this argument, we appeal to the fact that all quantum\ncomputation is simulable using classical computation albeit with\nan efficiency loss. Other than their use of quantum information and\nalgorithms, quantum computers are indistinct from classical ones.\nHence, from a high-level design perspective, the only information\nelement that needs to be considered when developing quantum\nsoftware is when quantum (rather than classical) information is\nbeing used.\nThe one remaining information element we have not discussed\nis algorithm efficiency. If quantum computation is to be used, it\nwill most likely be due to the efficient algorithms at its disposal.\nThat said, algorithm efficiency is not a solely quantum consider-\nation. UML itself does not inherently have language elements for\nalgorithm efficiency (beyond user-defined notes). It does, however,\nhave several extensions used and proposed for this purpose(see\ne.g.[4]). Other modeling languages may also have definite algorithm\nefficiency elements. We argue that it is best to use existing language\nelements when they are available.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nCP-D would like to acknowledge funding through the EPSRC Quan-\ntum Communications Hub (EP/T001011/1).
