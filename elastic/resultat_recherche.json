To provide high-quality explanations\nat scale, numerous systems automate the process by tracing the\nexecution of code [8, 12], defining terms [9], giving hints [16],\nand providing error-specific feedback [10, 16]. However, these ap-\nproaches often require manual effort to configure and only explain\na single aspect of a given code segment. Large language models\n(LLMs) are also changing how students interact with code [7]. For\nexample, Github\u2019s Copilot can generate code for programmers [4],\nleading researchers to raise concerns about cheating [7]. Instead,\nour work focuses on LLMs\u2019 potential to support learning by explain-\ning numerous aspects of a given code snippet. This poster features\na systematic analysis of the diverse natural language explanations\nthat GPT-3 can generate automatically for a given code snippet. We\npresent a subset of three use cases from our evolving design space\nof AI Explanations of Code.\n2\nUSE CASES\nTo understand the types of explanations GPT-3 [2] can generate,\nwe issued over 700 prompts across numerous code snippets. An\nexample prompt and resulting explanation is shown in Figure 1.\nWe discovered eight explanation types and Figure 2 includes three\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or\nclassroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed\nfor profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation\non the first page.

The\nadditional types include: 1) tracing the execution of code, 2) fixing\nbugs and explaining how they were fixed, 3) generating analogies\nto real world settings, 4) listing relevant programming concepts,\nand 5) predicting the console output.\nFigure 1: A prompt and explanation based on analogy.\n2.1\nAnalyzing and explaining time complexity\nInstructors rate time complexity as the most difficult programming\ntopic [17]. However, understanding time complexity is important [6,\n13] because it facilitates decision-making so students choose an\nappropriate algorithm for a given problem. This use case shows\nGPT-3 can identify and explain time complexity.\n2.2\nIdentifying common mistakes made by\nbeginner programmers\nCommonality exists in how students solve programming prob-\nlems [15] and the mistakes they make [1, 11]. Pedagogical tech-\nniques, such as the \u2018muddiest point\u2019 highlight these common and\nmost confusing concepts [3, 14]. GPT-3 can automatically create\na checklist of common mistakes students might make regarding a\ngiven code snippet.\n37\nICER 2022, August 7\u201311, 2022, Lugano and Virtual Event, Switzerland\nMacNeil et al.\nFigure 2: Three example explanations automatically generated by GPT-3 for an \u2018anonymized\u2019 Binary Search code snippet.\n2.3\nSummarizing code at multiple levels of\nabstraction\nBefore understanding how a code snippet executes, it is often useful\nto understand the purpose of the code [5]. The summary gener-\nated by GPT-3 and shown in Figure 2 defines the goal, traces the\nexecution, and highlights relevant CS concepts such as arrays.\n3\nDISCUSSION\nOur three use cases demonstrate the potential for GPT-3 to explain\ncode for intro CS students. Our poster presentation will feature all\neight explanation types as a design space of explanations to convey\nthe diversity of explanations that can be generated by LLMs. We will\nhighlight best practices for generating effective explanations and\npitfalls that lead to less effective explanations. We are evaluating\nthe usefulness of these explanations in a series of summer classes.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Amjad Altadmri and Neil CC Brown. 2015. 37 million compilations: Investigating\nnovice programming mistakes in large-scale student data.

This is likely due to a fact that the\ninvestment necessary for engaging in the spamming industry is\nrelatively low. As a result of this, we currently have a system that\nidentifies every email as suspicious, which has caused major expen-\nditures in the investment of defense systems [12]. Emails are used\nfor online crimes like fraud, hacking, phishing, E-mail bombing, bul-\nlying, and spamming. [16]. Algorithms that are based on machine\nlearning (ML) are now the most effective and often used approach to\nthe recognition of spam. Phishing, which is defined as a fraudulent\nattempt to acquire private information by masquerading as a trust-\nworthy party in electronic communication, has rapidly advanced\npast use of simple techniques and the tactic of casting a wide net;\ninstead, spear phishing uses a variety of sophisticated techniques\nto target a single high-value individual. Other researchers used NB,\nDecision Trees, and SVM to compare the performance of supervised\nML algorithms for spam identification [6]. Spam emails clog up re-\ncipients\u2019 inboxes with unsolicited communications, which frustrate\nthem and push them into the attacker\u2019s planned traps [7]. As a re-\nsult, spam messages unquestionably pose a risk to both email users\nand the Internet community. In addition, Users may occasionally\nread the entire text of an unsolicited message that is delivered to\nthe target users\u2019 inboxes without realizing that the message is junk\nand then choosing to avoid it. Building a framework for email spam\ndetection is the aim of this project. In this approach, we combine the\nWord-Embedding Network with the CNN layer, Bi-LSTM, and GRU\n(BiLSTM+GRU). CNN layers are used to speed up training time\nbefore the Bi-LSTM network, and more advanced textual character-\nistics are extracted with the use of this network in comparison to\nthe straight LSTM network, in less time. Gated recurrent neural net-\nworks (GRUs) are then added because they train more quickly and\nperform better for language modeling. To evaluate and investigate\nvarious machine learning algorithms for predicting email spam,\nand develop a hybrid classification algorithm to filter email spam\nbefore employing an ensemble classification algorithm to forecast\nit. To put an innovative technique into practice and compare it to\nthe current method in terms of various metrics. Ensemble learn-\ning, a successful machine learning paradigm, combines a group of\nlearners rather than a single learner to forecast unknown target\nattributes. Bagging, boosting, voting, and stacking are the four main\ntypes of ensemble learning techniques. To increase performance,\nan integrated method and the combining of two or three algorithms\nare also suggested. Extraction of text-based features takes a long\ntime. Furthermore, it can be challenging to extract all of the crucial\ninformation from a short text. Over the span associated with this\n181\nIC3 2023, August 03\u201305, 2023, Noida, India\nSachan et al.\nresearch, we utilize Bidirectional Large Short-Term Memories (Bi-\nLSTM) in conjunction with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nto come up with an innovative method to the detection of spam.\nBagging and boosting approaches were widely preferred in this\nstudy. Contribution and paper organization is as follows: section 1.1\ndescribes literature study, section 1.2 describe motivation for this\nresearch work, section 2 sketches procedure of details implemen-\ntation, Section 3 present experimental setup, dataset description\nand evaluation metrics, and section 4 summarizing outcomes of the\nexperiment.\n1.1\nRelated Work\nEmail is indeed the second most frequently utilized Internet appli-\ncation as well as the third most common method of cyberbullying,\nclaims one study. Cybercriminals exploit it in a number of ways,\nincluding as sending obscene or abusive messages, adding viruses\nto emails, snatching the private information of victims, and ex-\nposing it to a broad audience. Spam letters made up 53.95% of all\nemail traffic in March 2020. We examine three main types of un-\nlawful emails in our study. First are fake emails, which are sent\nto manipulate recipients to submit sensitive information. The sec-\nond as being cyberbullying\u2019s use of harassing emails to threaten\nindividuals. Suspicious emails that describe illegal activities belong\nto the third category. Many researchers have earlier contributed\nmassively to this subject. The researcher claims there is some proof\nthat suspicious emails were sent before to the events of 9/11. [14].\nWhen it comes to data labeling, there are also convinced rule-based\napproaches and technologies ( like VADER) that are used, even\nthough their efficiency of the are together is adversely affected. A\nhidden layer, which itself is essential for vectorization, is the top\nlayer of the model. We use oversampling methods for this minority\nclass because of the absence of data. Sampling techniques can help\nwith multicollinearity, but they have an impact on simulation re-\nsults. Oversampling causes data to be randomly repeated, which\naffects test data because dividing data may result in duplicates. Un-\ndersampling may result in the loss of some strong information. In\norder to advance email research, it is crucial to provide datasets on\ncriminal activity. P. Garg et al. (2021) [5], which revealed that spam\nin an email was detected in 70 percent of business emails, spam was\nestablished as an obstacle for email administrators. Recognizing\nspam and getting rid of it were the primary concerns, as spam can\nbe offensive, may lead to other internet sites being tricked, which\ncan offer harmful data, and can feature those who are not particu-\nlar with their content using NLP. To select the best-trained model,\neach mail transmission protocol requires precise and effective email\nclassification, a machine learning comparison is done. Our study\nhas suggested that innovative deep learning outperforms learning\nalgorithms like SVM and RF. Current studies on the classification\nof emails use a variety of machine learning (ML) techniques, with\na few of them focusing on the study of the sentiments consisted of\nwithin email databases. The lack of datasets is a significant obstacle\nto email classification. There are few publicly accessible E-mail\ndatasets, thus researchers must use these datasets to test their hy-\npotheses or gather data on their own. Authors[15] describe supplied\ntwo-phased outlier detection models to enhance the IIOT network\u2019s\ndependability. Artificial Neural Network, SVM, Gaussian NB, and\nRF (random forest) ensemble techniques were performed to forecast\nclass labels, and the outputs were input into a classifying unit to\nincrease accuracy. A method for content-based phishing detection\nwas presented by the authors in [2], to classify phishing emails,\nthey employed RF. They categorize spam and phishing emails. They\nenhanced phishing email classifiers with more accurate predictions\nby extracting features. They showed some effective Machine learn-\ning spam filtering techniques. When the PCA method is used, it will\nlower the number of features in the dataset. The collected features\ngo through the PCA algorithm to reduce the number of features.\nThe PCA method is used to make a straightforward representation\nof the information which illustrates the amount of variability there\nis in the data. The authors of [20] presented the Fuzzy C-means\nmethod for classifying spam email. To stop spam, they implemented\na membership threshold value. A methodology to identify unla-\nbeled data was put forth by the authors of [1] and applied motive\nanalysis to the Enron data collection. They divided the data into\ncategories that were favorable, negative, and neutral. They grouped\nthe data using k-means clustering, an unsupervised ML technique\nand then classified it using the supervised ML techniques SVM and\nNB. Hina, Maryam, and colleagues (2021) implemented Sefaced:\nDeep learning-based semantic analysis and categorization of e-mail\ndata using a forensic technique. For multiclass email classification,\nSeFACED employs a Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRU) based\non Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Different random weight ini-\ntializations affect LSTMs [9]. Zhang, Yan, et al.(2019) Experiments\non three-way game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) email spam filter-\ning show that it is feasible to significantly boost coverage without\ndecreasing accuracy [23]. According to Xia et al. [22], SMS spam\nhas been identified using machine learning model such as naive\nbayes , vector-space modeling, support vector machines (SVM),\nlong selective memory machines (LSTM), and convolutional neural\nnetworks including every instance of a method for categorizing\ndata. Elshoush, Huwaida, et al. (2019) Using adaboost and stochastic\ngradient descent (sgd) algorithms for e-mail filtering with R and\norange software spam [3]. Orange software was used to create the\nclassifications, which included Adaboost and SGD. The majority of\nresearchers focused on text-based email spam classification meth-\nods because image-based spam can be filtered in the early stages\nof pre-processing. There are widely used word bag (BoW) model,\nwhich believes that documents are merely unordered collections\nof words, is the foundation for these techniques. Kumaresan [11]\nexplains SVM with a cuckoo search algorithm was used to extract\ntextual features for spam detection. Renuka and Visalakshi made\nuse of svm [17] spam email identification, followed by selecting\nfeatures using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Here we have used\nlabeled dataset to train the hybrid classifier. We used TF-IDF for\nfeature extraction [20] and Textual features for spam detection\nwere extracted using SVM and a cuckoo search algorithm. [4] for\nfiltering out the spam email. Combining the integrated strategy to\nthe pure SVM and NB methods, overall accuracy is really improved.\nMoreover, accurate detection for spam email has been proposed\nusing the Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) and Particle Swarm\nOptimization\u2019s (PSO) algorithm. PSO is used in this instance to\nimprove the effectiveness of the classifier.\n182\nSemantic Analysis and Classification of Emails through Informative Selection of Features and Ensemble AI Model\nIC3 2023, August 03\u201305, 2023, Noida, India\n1.2\nMotivation and Novelty\nEmail is most common form of communication between people\nin this digital age. Many users have been victims of spam emails,\nand their personal information has been compromised. The email\nClassification technique is employed to identify and filter junk\nmail, junk, and virus-infected emails prior to reach a user\u2019s inbox.\nExisting email classification methods result in irrelevant emails\nand/or the loss of valuable information. Keeping these constraints\nin mind, the following contributions are made in this paper:\n\u2022 Text-based feature extraction is a lengthy process. Further-\nmore, extracting every important feature from text is difficult.\nIn this paper, we show how to employ GRU with Convo-\nlutional Neural Networks and Bidirectional-LSTM to find\nspam.\n\u2022 Used Word-Embeddings, BiLSTM, and Gated Recurrent Neu-\nral Networks to examine the relationships, sentimental con-\ntent, and sequential way of email contents.\n\u2022 Applied CNN before the Bi-LSTM network, training time can\nbe sped up. This network can also extract more advanced\ntextual features faster than the Bi-LSTM network alone when\ncombined with the GRU network.\n\u2022 We use Enorn Corpora datasets and compute precision, re-\ncall, and f-score to assess how well the suggested technique\nperforms. Our model outperforms several well-known ma-\nchine learning techniques as well as more contemporary\nmethods for spam message detection.\n2\nPROPOSED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND\nMODEL\nE-mail is a valuable tool for communicating with other users. Email\nallows the sender to efficiently forward millions of advertisements\nat no cost. Unfortunately, this scheme is now being used in a variety\nof organizations. As a result, a massive amount of redundant emails\nis known as spam or junk mail, many people are confused about the\nemails in their E- Mailboxes. Each learning sequence is given for-\nward as well as backward to two different LSTM networks that are\nattached to the same outputs layer in order for bidirectional Lstms\nto function. This indicates that the Bi-LSTM has detailed sequential\ninformation about all points before and following each point in a\nspecific sequence. In other words, we concatenate the outputs from\nboth the forward and the backward LSTM at each time step rather\nthan just encoding the sequence in the forward direction. Each\nword\u2019s encoded form now comprehends the words that come before\nand after it. This is a problem for the Internet community. The di-\nagram depicts various stages that aid in the prediction of email spam:\nBecause real-world data is messy and contains unnecessary infor-\nmation and duplication, data preprocessing is critical in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP). The major preprocessing steps are de-\npicted below.\n2.1\nNLP Tokenization\nTokenization of documents into words follows predefined rules.\nThe tokenization step is carried out in Python with spacy library.\n2.2\nStop Words Removal\nStop words appear infrequently or frequently in the document, but\nthey are less significant in terms of importance. As a result, these\nare removed to improve data processing.\n2.3\nText Normalization\nA word\u2019s lexicon form or order may differ. Thus, they must all be\nchanged to their root word to be correctly analyzed. Lemmatization\nand stemming are the two methods that can be used for normal-\nization. When a word\u2019s final few characters are removed to create\na shorter form, even if that form has no meaning, the procedure\nis known as stemming. lemmatization [21] is a mixture of corpus-\nbased an rule-based methods, and it retains the context of a term\nwhile changing it back to its root.\n2.4\nFeature Extraction\nfeature extraction which transforms the initial text into its features\nso that it may be used for modeling after being cleaned up and\nnormalized. Before predicting them, we use a specific way to give\nweights to specific terms in our document. While it is simple for a\ncomputer to process numbers, we choose to represent individual\nwords numerically. In such cases, we choose word embeddings. IDF\nis the count of documents containing the term divided by the total\nnumber of documents, and occurrence is the amount of instances a\nword appears in a document. We derive characteristics based on\nequations. 1,2,3,4,5, and 6. We use equations to derive properties.\n\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 = \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc53 \u2217\n\ufffd 1\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53\n\ufffd\n(1)\n\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 = \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc53 \u2217 Inverse(\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 )\n(2)\n\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc51, \ud835\udc37) = \ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc51).\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc37)\n(3)\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53 (\ud835\udc61,\ud835\udc51) = log\n\ud835\udc41\n|\ud835\udc51\ud835\udf16\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc61\ud835\udf16\ud835\udc37|\n(4)\nA word2vec neural network-based approach is the method that is\nutilized for this goal as the tool. The following equation, referred\nto as 5, shows how word2vec handles word context through the\nuse of probability-accurate measurements. Here letter D stands for\nthe paired-wise display of a set of words, while the letters w and c0\nor c1 represent paired word context that originated from a larger\ncollection of set D.\n\ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc37 = 1 | \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc5011:\ud835\udc58) =\n1\n1 + \ud835\udc52\u2212(\ud835\udc64\u00b7\ud835\udc5011+\ud835\udc64\u00b7\ud835\udc5012+...+\ud835\udc64\u00b7\ud835\udc501\ud835\udc58)\n(5)\n\ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc37 = 1 | \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc501:\ud835\udc58) =\n1\n1 + \ud835\udc52\u2212(\ud835\udc64\u00b7\ud835\udc500)\n(6)\n183\nIC3 2023, August 03\u201305, 2023, Noida, India\nSachan et al.\n2.5\nWord-Embeddings\nWord-Embedding helps to improve on the typical \"bag-of-words\"\nworldview, which requires a massive sparse feature vector to score\nevery word individually to represent this same entire vocabulary.\nThis perception is sparse because the vocabulary is large, and each\nword or document is defined by a massive vector. Using a word\nmap-based dictionary, word embedding needs to be converted terms\n(words) into real value feature vectors. There are two basic issues\nwith standard feature engineering techniques for deep learning.\nData is represented using sparse vectors, and the second is that\nsome of the meanings of words are not taken into consideration.\nSimilar phrases will have values in embedding vectors that are\nalmost real-valued. The Input length in our proposed study is set\nto 700 for our suggested model. If the texts seemed to be integer\nencoded with value systems between 10 and 20, the vocabulary\ndistance would be 11. Our data is encoded as integers, and the input\nand output dimensions are both set to 50,000. The embedding layer\noutcome will be used in successive layers and for BiLSTM and GRU\nlayers.\n2.6\nMachine Learning Model\nWithin the scope of the research, we are using the subsequent ma-\nchine learning techniques, to examine and compare the overall\nefficacy of our suggested Bi-LSTM strategy: Support Vector Ma-\nchine, Gaussian NB, Logistic Regression, K - nearest neighbors, and\nRandom Forest (RF).\n2.7\nConvolution Network\nThe popular RNN model generally performs well but takes too\nlong to train the model incorporating the textual sequential data.\nWhen a layer is added after the RNN layer, the model\u2019s learning\nduration is considerably decreased. Higher-level feature extraction\nis another benefit. [19] additionally possible using the convolutional\nlayer. In essence, the convolution layer looks for combinations of\nthe various words or paragraphs in the document that involve the\nfilters. We use features with 128 dimensions and a size 10 for each.\nFor this task, the Relu activation function is utilized. After that, the\none-dimensional largest pooling layers with a pooling size of 4 are\nput on the data in order to obtain higher-level features.\n2.8\nBiLSTM Network with GRU\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique of text sentiment anal-\nysis is particularly well-liked and frequently applied. Recurrent\nneural networks (RNN) surpass conventional neural networks. be-\ncause it can remember the information from earlier time steps\nthanks to its memory. A state vector is combined with an RNN\u2019s\ndata to create a new state vector. The resulting state vector uses the\npresent to recollect past knowledge. The RNN is straightforward\nand is based on the following equations:\n\u210e\ud835\udc61 = tanh (\ud835\udc4a\u210e\u210e\u210e\ud835\udc61\u22121 +\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udf0b\u210e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61)\n(7)\n\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc4a\u210e\ud835\udc66\u210e\ud835\udc61\n(8)\nThe vanilla RNN[18]is not very good at remembering previous\nsequences. In addition to that, RNN struggles with diminishing\ngradient descent. A kind of RNN is a long short-term recall network\n(LSTM), solves a vanishing gradient descent problem and learns\nlong-term dependencies[10]. LSTM was actually created to address\nthe problem of long-term reliance. LSTM has the unique ability to\nrecall. The cell state is the LSTM model\u2019s central concept. With\nonly a small amount of linear interaction, the cell state follows the\nsequence essentially unmodified from beginning to end. gate of\nan LSTM is also significant. Under the command of these gates,\ninformation is safely inserted to or eliminated from the cell stated.\nThe following equations are used by the LSTM model to update\neach cell:\n\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf0e\n\ufffd\n\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc53 \u00b7 [\u210e\ud835\udc61\u22121,\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61] + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc53\n\ufffd\n(9)\nIn this case, Xt denotes input, and ht is the hidden state at the t\ntime step. The following is the revised cell state Ct:\n\ud835\udc56t = \ud835\udf0e (\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56 [\u210e\ud835\udc61\u22121,\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61] + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56)\n(10)\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc47 = tanh (\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc50 [\u210e\ud835\udc61\u22121,\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61] + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc61)\n(11)\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc61 \u2217 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61\u22121 + \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61 \u2217 \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc47\n(12)\nHere, we may compute the output and hidden state at t time steps\nusing the point-wise multiplication operator *.\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udf0e (\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc5c \u00b7 [\u210e\ud835\udc61\u22121,\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc61] + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5c)\n(13)\n\u210e\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc61 \u2217 tanh (\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc61)\n(14)\nDue to the reality it only considers all prior contexts from the\npresent one, LSTM does have a few drawbacks. As a result of this,\nit may accept data from preceding time steps through LSTM as well\nas RNN. Therefore, in order to avoid this issue, further improve-\nments are carried out with the help of a bidirectional recurrent\nneural network(Bi-RNN). BiRNN [13] can handle two pieces of in-\nformation from both the front and the back. Bi-LSTM is created\nby combining the Bi-RNN and LSTM. As a result, operating LSTM\nhas advantages such as cell state storage so that BiRNN have way\nto acknowledge from the context before and after. As a conse-\nquence of this, it provides the Bi-LSTM with the advantages of an\nLSTM with feedback for the next layer. Remembering long-term\ndependencies is a significant new benefit of Bi-LSTM. The output,\nwhich is a feature vector, will be based on the call state. Finally,\nwe forecast the probability of email content as Normal, Fraudu-\nlent, Harassment, and Suspicious Emails using as an input to the\nsoftmax activation function, which is a weighted sum of the dense\nlayer\u2019s outputs. To regulate the information flow, GRU employs\nthe point-wise multiplying function and logistic sigmoid activation.\nThe GRU has hidden states of storage memory and does not have\ndistinct memory cells or units for state control. The W, U, and b\nvectors, which stand for weights, gates, and biases, respectively, are\ncrucial variables that must be calculated during the creation of the\nGRU model. For training reasons, the pre-trained word embedding\nknown as the Glove vector is used. They made it clear that GRU\nis the superior model when there is a large amount of training\ndata for textual groups and word embedding is available. BiLSTM,\nCNN, and GRU is required so as to compensate for the deletion\nof the document\u2019s long-term and short-term connections. In our\ncase, the embedding dimension, maximum sequence length, and\nlexicon size were used to start the LSTM embedding layer in three\nseparate LSTM models. The input vector was modified to make it\nappropriate for such a Conv1D layer, prior situations\u2019 sequences are\nreturned by LSTM layer. The \"return sequences\" of the LSTM layer\nmust be set to False when the subsequent state is free of the gated\n184\nSemantic Analysis and Classification of Emails through Informative Selection of Features and Ensemble AI Model\nIC3 2023, August 03\u201305, 2023, Noida, India\narchitecture. Quantity of learning parameters must be taken into\nconsideration. A 350-unit LSTM layer was set - up, and different\nLSTM unit combinations were tested. More importantly, because\nit has more parts, the model made with BiLSTM will take longer\nto train. Bidirectional LSTM is the name of a particular kind of\nrecurrent neural network that is primarily used for the processing\nof natural languages. (BiLSTM). It is able to use data from both\nsides, and, in contrast to regular LSTM, it enables input flow in\nboth directions. It is an effective instrument for demonstrating the\nlogical relationships between words and phrases, and this involves\nboth the forward and backward directions of the sequence. In con-\nclusion, BiLSTM works by adding one extra layer of LSTM, causing\nthe information flow to travel in the other direction. It only denotes\nthat the input sequence runs in reverse at the next LSTM layer. Mul-\ntiple operations, including averaging, summation, multiplication,\nand concatenation, are then applied to the results of the two LSTM\nlayers. The gated design of Bi-LSTM and GRU networks solves\nthe disappearing gradient and exploding problems. A good way to\nhandle more long sequences is to use Bi-LSMT and GRU together.\nGRU works well with datasets that don\u2019t have text. In two to three\nrounds, the complicated CNN+BiLSTM+GRU model learns the long\nsequence of email text well. We have used word embedding, cnn,\nbidirectional lstm and gru networks as our three building blocks\nto separate email messages based on their sentiment and text\u2019s\nsequential features. Also, we succinctly demonstrate below why\nthese blocks help identify email spam:\n\u2022 First, We have used the Sequence - to - sequence Lstm as the\ncurrent block in the networks since it can retrieve both the\nprevious and next sequences from the current. More so than\na straightforward LSTM network, it can also recognize and\nextract text sentiment and sequential properties.\n\u2022 Second, we extract the more complex and advanced charac-\nteristics for Bi-LSTM network using Convolutional Network\nblock, which is the network\u2019s second block after the Bi-LSTM\nblock. Bi-LSTM takes a long time to extract text-based fea-\ntures, hence one of the reasons for using this block is to\nreduce the network\u2019s overall training time.\n3\nEXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\n3.1\nExperimental Setup\nWe divided the information into training and testing groups of\n80/20. We divided the remaining 20% of the 80 percent training\ndata into test data for the model. Construct, compute, and evaluate\nthe efficacy of the suggested method using the Pythonic packages\nKeras, as TensorFlow and Scikit learn.\n3.2\nDataset Description\nEmail spam detection is the foundation of this research project. The\ndataset includes normal emails from the Enron corpora, deceptive\nemails from phished email corpora, harassment emails chosen from\nhate speech, and the offensive dataset. Only the content of the email\nbody is used for analysis; all header information, including sender,\ntopic, CC, and BCC, are eliminated. Word2vector, TF-IDF, and Word\nEmbedding are used to extract characteristics from the email mes-\nsage and classify them. This dataset[8] is publicly available. The\npresented model is implemented using Python, and several metrics,\nincluding accuracy, precision, and recall, are used to examine the\noutcomes.\n3.3\nEvaluation Metrics and Results\nClassifier performance is assessed Using metrics such as accuracy,\nprecision, and recall. Four terms make up a confusion matrix that\nis used to calculate these metrics.\n\u2022 True positives (TP) are positive values that have been accu-\nrately assigned the positive label.\n\u2022 The negative values that are accurately identified as negative\nare known as True Negatives (TN).\n\u2022 True Negative values are those that can be accurately identi-\nfied as being negative (TN).\n\u2022 Positive readings that have been mistakenly labeled as nega-\ntive are known as False Negatives (FN).\nAssess the efficacy of the suggested model is listed below:\n3.3.1\nAccuracy.

It requires less time training and a higher\nexpandable model. Any bottlenecks are created by predictions and\nthe increasing number of distinct units of information. This model\nis useful for dealing with issue-related classifications that consist\nof two or more than two classes. So suggested Ensemble model, out\nof these six classifiers, produces more accurate findings.\n185\nIC3 2023, August 03\u201305, 2023, Noida, India\nSachan et al.\nFigure 1: Performance Analysis\n3.4\nComparative Analysis\nA model\u2019s ability to fit new data is measured by the validation\nloss, whereas its ability to fit training data is determined by the\ntraining loss. The two main variables that decide whether in which\nlearning is efficient or not are validation loss and training loss.\nLSTM and Suggested Ensemble hybrid Models have equivalent loss\nand accuracy. In this context, we are contrasting the LSTM with the\nproposed model (CNN, Bilstm, and GRU) in terms of their respective\nvalidation accuracies and losses. The model\u2019s accuracy was at its\nhighest after 14 epochs of operation when it achieved an accuracy\nof roughly 97-98% while minimizing model loss.\nFigure 2: LSTM Model Training and Validation Accuracy\nFigure 3: LSTM Model Training and Validation Loss\nFigure 4: Ensemble Model (CNN,BiLSTM+GRU) Training\nand Validation Accuracy\nFigure 5: Ensemble Model (CNN,BiLSTM+GRU)Training\nand Validation Loss\n186\nSemantic Analysis and Classification of Emails through Informative Selection of Features and Ensemble AI Model\nIC3 2023, August 03\u201305, 2023, Noida, India\nIn this Proposed ensemble hybrid model\u2019s train accuracy is 98.7%\nValidation accuracy is 97.32% and LSTM has train accuracy of 97.41%\nand validation accuracy is 95.2%. So based on figures 3 and 5 indicate\nthe validation loss for LSTM and the proposed ensemble hybrid\nmodel to be 0.93 and 0.84, respectively, and figures 2 and 4 show the\nvalidation accuracy to be 95.2% and 97.3%, respectively. LSTM and\nthe proposed hybrid model used ensemble artificial intelligence,\nwith the proposed hybrid model outperforming the LSTM. We\ndecide on dense architecture as the final model for identifying the\ntext messages as spam or nonspam based on loss, accuracy, and the\naforementioned charts. The loss and accuracy over epochs are more\nstable than LSTM, and the Proposed classifier has a straightforward\nstructure.\n4\nCONCLUSION\nThe model is composed of four networks Word-Embeddings, CNN,\nBi-LSTM, and GRU. We may train the model more quickly by using\nthe convolutional layer first, followed by the word-embedding layer,\nand then the BiLSTM network. The Bidirectional LSTM network\nalso has higher-level properties that we can extract.

Introduction \nThe goal of this effort is to explore a model for design and \nimplementation of an AI agent for turn based games. This model \nprovides for building more capable computer opponents that rely \non strategies that closely resemble human approach in solving \nproblems opposed to classical computational centric heuristics in \ngame AI. In this manner the computational resources can be \nfocused on more sensible strategies for the game play.  \nWith the advancement in computer hardware increasingly \nmore computing power is left for executing AI algorithms in \ngames. In the past AI in games was mainly a cheating set of \ninstructions that simulated the increasing difficulty in the game \nenvironment so that the player had the illusion of real counterpart. \nImprovement in available memory and processing power allows \nimplementation of more intelligent algorithms for building the \ngame environment as well as direct interaction with the human \nplayers.   \nIn this particular research the emphasis is put on the \ninteraction between the AI agent and a computer player in the \nrealm of the game rules. It is particularly focused on turn based \ngames that have the elements of uncertainty like dice or concealed \ninformation. At the beginning a description of Game AI \nalgorithms are given; such as Game Trees and Minimax. The \nfollowing section describes an approach of using AI Planning to \nimprove building Game Trees in games with imperfect \ninformation where Game Trees tend to be very large with high \ngrowth ratio. Section 4 discusses another approach that provides a \nsignificant reduction to the number of considered moves in order \nto find the favorable strategy of the AI player. This approach uses \nAI Planning techniques and Case Base Reasoning (CBR) to plan \nfor different scenarios in predetermined strategies which would be \nanalogous to human player experience in the particular game. The \nCBR database illustrates a set of past experiences for the AI \nproblem and the AI Planning illustrates the procedure to deal with \nthe given situation in the game. In the next two sections \nimplementations and evaluations of both approaches are given. \nThe AI Planning approach is implemented with the Tic-tac-toe \ngame and the combined AI Planning and CBR approach is \nimplemented with a model for the Monopoly game. The last part \ncontains conclusions and future work ideas.  \n2. Game Trees and Minimax \nGame Trees are common model for evaluating how different \ncombinations of moves from the player and his opponents will \naffect the future position of the player and eventually the end \nresult of the game. An algorithm that decides on the next move by \nevaluating the results from the built Game Tree is minimax [1]. \nMinimax assumes that the player at hand will always choose the \nbest possible move for him, in other words the player will try to \nselect the move that maximizes the result of the evaluation \nfunction over the game state. So basically the player at hand needs \nto choose the best move overall while taking into account that the \nnext player(s) will try to do the same thing. Minimax tries to \nmaximize the minimum gain. Minimax can be applied to multiple \nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for \npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are \nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that \ncopies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Furthermore, V is \nthe best payoff each can expect to receive from a play of the \ngame; that is, these mixed strategies are the optimal strategies for \nthe two players. \nThis theorem was established by John von Neumann, who is \nquoted as saying \"As far as I can see, there could be no theory of \ngames \u2026 without that theorem \u2026 I thought there was nothing \nworth publishing until the Minimax Theorem was proved\" [2]. \nA simple example of minimax can be observed by building a \ngame tree of the tic-tac-toe game. The tic-tac-toe game is a simple \ngame which can end by the first player wining, the second player \nwining or a tie. There are nine positions for each of the players in \nwhich at each turn the player puts X or O sign. If the player has \nthree adjacent signs in a row, column or the two diagonals he or \nshe wins. This game has limited number of position and it is well \nsuited for building the whole game tree. The leaves of this tree \nwill be final positions in the game. A heuristics evaluation \nfunction will also need to be written to evaluate the value of each \nnode along the way. \n3. AI Planning for building Game Trees \n3.1.1 AI Planning \nAI Planning also referred as Automated Planning and \nScheduling is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on \nfinding strategies or sequences of actions that reach a predefined \ngoal [3]. Typical execution of AI Planning algorithms is by \nintelligent agents, autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles. \nOpposed to classical control or classification AI Planning results \nwith complex solutions that are derived from multidimensional \nspace. \n AI Planning algorithms are also common in the video game \ndevelopment. They solve broad range of problems from path \nfinding to action planning. A typical planner takes three inputs: a \ndescription of the initial state of the world, a description of the \ndesired goal, and a set of possible actions. Some efforts for \nincorporating planning techniques for building game trees have \nalso shown up, similar to the approach explored in this effort. In \naddition Cased Based Reasoning [4] techniques are also gathering \npopularity in developing strategies based in prior knowledge \nabout the problems in the games. One of the benefits from \nHierarchical Task Network (HTN) [5] planning is the possibility \nto build Game Trees based on HTN plans; this method is \ndescribed in the following section. \n3.2 Game Trees with AI Planning \nAn adaptation of the HTN planning can be used to build \nmuch smaller and more efficient game trees. This idea has already \nbeen implemented in the Bridge Baron a computer program for \nthe game of Contact Bridge [6]. \nComputer programs based on Game Tree search techniques \nare now as good as or better than humans in many games like \nChess [7] and checkers [8], but there are some difficulties in \nbuilding a game tree for games that have imperfect information \nand added uncertainty like card or games with dice. The main \nproblem is the enormous number of possibilities that the player \ncan choose from in making his move. In addition some of the \nmoves are accompanied with probabilities based on the random \nelements in the games. The number of possible moves \nexponentially grows with each move so the depth of the search \nhas to be very limited to accommodate for the memory \nlimitations.  \nThe basic idea behind using HTN for building game trees is \nthat the HTN provides the means of expressing high level goals \nand describing strategies how to reach those goals. These goals \nmay be decomposed in goals at lower level called sub-goals. This \napproach closely resembles the way a human player usually \naddresses a complex problem. It is also good for domains where \nclassical search for solution is not feasible due to the vastness of \nthe problem domain or uncertainties. \n3.2.1 Hierarchical Task Networks \nThe Hierarchical Task Network, or HTN, is an approach to \nautomated planning in which the dependency among actions can \nbe given in the form of networks [9] [Figure 1]. \nA simple task network (or just a task network for short) is an \nacyclic digraph \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd in which U is the node set, E is the \nedge set, and each node \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd contains a task \ufffd\ufffd. The edges of \ufffd\ndefine a partial ordering of U. If the partial ordering is total, then \nwe say that \ufffd is totally ordered, in which case \ufffd can be written as \na sequence of tasks \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd.\nFigure 1: Simple Hierarchical Task Network \nA Simple Task Network (STN) method is a 4-tuple of its name, \ntask, precondition and a task network. The name of the method \nlets us refer unambiguously to substitution instances of the \nmethod, without having to write the preconditions and effects \nexplicitly. The task tells what kind of task can be applied if the \npreconditions are met. The preconditions specify the conditions \nthat the current state needs to satisfy in order for the method to be \napplied. And the network defines the specific subtasks to \naccomplish in order to accomplish the task. \nA method is relevant for a task if the current state satisfies the \npreconditions of a method that implements that task. This task can \nbe then substituted with the instance of the method. The \nsubstitution is basically giving the method network as a solution \nfor the task. \nIf there is a task \u201cGo home\u201d and the distance to home is 3km \n[Figure 2] and there exists a method walk-to and this method has a \nprecondition that the distance is less than 5km, then a substation \nto the task \u201cGo home\u201d can be made with this method instance.  \nFigure 2: HTN Method \nBuy milk\nGo to (shop)\nPurchase \nGo to (home)\nGo-to (from, to)\nWalk (to)\nIf (to \u2013 from) < 5km \n296\nDIMEA 2008\n3rd International Conference on Digital Interactive Media in Entertainment and Arts\nIf the distance is larger than 5km another meth\nto be substituted [Figure 3]. \nFigure 3: HTN Method 2 \nAn STN planning domain is a set of operatio\nmethods M.

How this is done, what part of the \nprocess that is focused, what type of problems that drives the \nmethods, etc. varies considerably, however\".  \nWhile the underlying ideas of CBR can be applied \nconsistently \nacross \napplication \ndomains, \nthe \nspecific \nimplementation of the CBR methods \u2013in particular retrieval and \nsimilarity functions\u2013 is highly customized to the application at \nhand. \n4.2 CBR and Games \nMany different implementations of CBR exist in games. \nCBR technology is nicely suited for recognizing complex \nsituations much easier and more elegant than traditional parameter \ncomparison or function evaluation. There are especially evident \ncases in real time strategies where different attack and defense of \nglobal strategies are nicely defined by CBR datasets and later used \nin the running games. Also intelligent bots behavior is also \nanother typical example. Depending on the number of enemy bots \nthe layout of the terrain and position of human players the CBR \nsystem finds the closest CBR case and employs that strategy \nagainst the human players which in prior evaluation was proved to \nbe highly efficient. \n5. Game Trees with AI Planning \u2013 Tic-tac-toe \nIn order to show the expressive power of AI Planning in \ndefining strategies for games, and the use of these plans to build \nGame Trees I implemented an algorithm that builds Game Trees \nfor the Tic-Tac-Toe game. \nThe game tree of Tic-Tac-Toe shows 255,168 possible \ngames of which 131,184 are won by X (the first player), 77904 \nare won by O and the rest 46,080 are draw [13]. All these games \ncan be derived from building a complete Game Tree.  \nEven though it is possible to build a complete game tree of \nTic-tac-toe it is definitely not an optimal solution. Many of the \nmoves in this tree would be symmetrical and also there are a many \nmoves that would be illogical or at least a bad strategy to even \nconsider.  \nSo what strategy should X (the first player) choose in order \nto win the game? \nThere are few positions that lead to certain victory. These \npositions involve simultaneous attack on two positions so the \nother player could not defend, basically the only trick in Tic-Tac-\nToe. \nFigure 6: Tic-tac-toe winning strategy positions \nPosition 1 leads to victory if the two of the three fields: top \nmiddle, bottom left corner and bottom right corner are free \n[Figure 6]. \nPosition 2 lead to victory if two of the three fields: top right \ncorner, bottom right corner and bottom middle are free [Figure ]. \nAnd in the third position if the two of center, middle top and \nmiddle left are available the position is a certain victory. \nThere are many different arrangements of the player\u2019s tokens \nthat give equivalent positions as these three positions. By using \nplanning we do not need to consider all possible layouts but just \nconsider these three similar to what a human would consider. \n The game starts from an empty table. \nThe two relevant strategies that would lead to these positions \nare to take one corner or to take the center [Figure 7]. \nFigure 7: Tic-tac-toe Two starting moves \nThe center position as we can see in the simulation results \nlead to a bigger number of victorious endings but it is also a \nstraight forward strategy with obvious defense strategy. \nAt this point we need to consider the moves of the opponent. \nIf we take the left branch the opponent moves can be a center, a \ncorner or a middle field. We also need to differentiate with a \nmove to a corner adjacent with our like top left or bottom right or \nacross the center to bottom right [Figure 8]. \nFigure 8: Tic-tac-toe opponent response to corner move \nIn cases one and two, we have a clear path to executing \nstrategy 3 so we need to capture the diagonally opposite field. \nAnd as for the third case the best way to go is to capture the center \nand go for strategy 1 or 2 depending of the opponent\u2019s next move.  \nFigure 9: Tic-tac-toe move 2 after corner opening \nThe first move leads to certain victory, O will have to go to \nthe center and X will achieve strategy 3 [Figure 9]. The second \nmove is a possible way to strategy 3 if O makes a mistake in the \nnext loop, so X goes to the opposite corner. For the third case \nsince O is playing a valid strategy the only move that leaves a \npossible mistake from O would be to take the center and wait for \nO to go to the middle and then achieve strategy 1 or 3 which will \nbe a symmetric situation to the one that we will find if we \nbranched with the center. \nFigure 10: Tic-tac-toe opponent response to center move \nIf we go back to the second branch [Figure 10], a possible \nway for the second player to engage is corner or middle. The first \n298\nDIMEA 2008\n3rd International Conference on Digital Interactive Media in Entertainment and Arts\nmove is a valid strategy for O and can be mee\ncorner move from X to try a mistake from O in \nthe same as in the third case above from the pre\nanother move would be go to the middle wh\nachieves strategy 1 or 2.  \nFigure 11: Tic-tac-toe Move 2 after cent\nThe fist move will lead to win if O moves \ndraw if it goes for the corners [Figure 11].

These calculations represent adaptation of the more general \nplanning associated with the cases in the CBR database. These \nadaptations are necessary due to the fact that the cases do not \nidentically correspond to the situation on the table. In addition \ncalculating the game position value of each node of the game tree \nis done by heuristic functions that incorporate economic \ncalculations of net present value, cash, and strategic layout and so \non. For example railroads in monopoly are known to be \nstrategically effective because they bring constant income even \nthough the income can be smaller than building on other \nproperties.  \n6.2 Details on the CBR Implementation \nThe implementation of the CBR is by using the JColibri2 \nplatform.  JColibri2 is an object-oriented framework in Java for \nbuilding CBR systems that is an evolution of previous work on \nknowledge intensive CBR [14].  \nFor this implementation we need to look into three particular \nclasses of the JColibri2 platform. The StandardCBRApplication, \nConnector, CBRQuery. For a JColibri2 implementation the \nStandardCBRApplication interface needs to be implemented.  \nThe CBR cycle executed accepts an instance of CBRQuery. \nThis class represents a CBR query to the CBR database. The \ndescription component (instance of CaseComponent) represents \nthe description of the case that will be looked up in the database. \nAll \ncases \nand \ncase \nsolutions \nare \nimplementing \nthe \nCaseComponent interface. \nThe JColibri2 platform connects to the CBR database via a \nConnector class. Each connector implements all the necessary \nmethods for accessing the database, retrieval of cases, storing and \ndeletion of cases. This implementation uses a custom XML \nstructure for holding the CBR cases. Since the game will not \nupdate the CBR database only read it, a XML solution satisfies \nthe needs. The XML file to a certain extent is similar to the XML \nrepresentation of the board. We are interested in finding one \nCBRCase that is the most similar case to the situation in the game \nat the time of the search. This procedure is done in the cycle \nmethod of the CBRApplication. The JColibri2 CBR comparison is \ndone by Nearest Neighbor (NN) search method.  \nJColibri2 offers implementations for NN search algorithms \nof simple attributes. These implementations are called local \nsimilarities. For complex attributes like in our case global \ncustomized similarity mechanisms need to be implemented. \nThe MonopolyDescription class [Figure 13] is basically a \nserialization of the GameState. It holds all the information about \nthe state of the board, the players, their amount of cash etc.  \nFigure 13: Class diagram of the Monopoly Case component \nmodels \nOn the other hand the MonopolySolution class holds the \nthree particular attributes that are needed for the planning, the \nplanning Domain, State and TaskList. \nThe game is implemented by using the Model-View-\nController software development pattern. The controller is \nresponsible for implementing the game rules and handling all of \nthe events in the game like roll of dice, input commands for \ntrading, auctioning and etc from the players. The View layer is \nresponsible for displaying the board and all of the input widgets \non to the game screen, and the models are data structures \nrepresenting the game state [Figure 14]. \nFigure 14: Class diagram of the Monopoly models \n6.2.1 Complex Similarity representation in CBR \nThe similarity measurement part of the Nearest Neighbor \nalgorithm JColibri2 is implemented by implementing the \nLocalSimiralrityFunction \nand \nthe \nGlobalSimiralityFunction \ninterface. A local similarity function is applied to simple attributes \nby the NN algorithm, and a global similarity function is applied to \ncompound attributes. In the case of our implementation the \nattributes of the MonopolyDescription are compound attributes \ndescribing the state of the board, number of players, amount of \ncash for every player and etc. Since MonopolyDescription is a \ncustom CaseComponent a global similarity function needs to be \nimplemented to accurately find the distance between different \nCBR cases. \nThe similarity mechanism is inseparable core element of the \nCBR system. This mechanism represents how the CBR decides \nwhich strategy is best suited for the particular situation by \n300\nDIMEA 2008\n3rd International Conference on Digital Interactive Media in Entertainment and Arts\ncalculating the distance or similarity to other cases in the \ndatabase.  \nFor the monopoly implementation we need to consider \nseveral basic strategies. Monopoly is based on investing in \nproperties and receiving revenues from those investments. One of \nthe basic strategies of the game is to build a set of properties that \nwill bring constant income larger than the one of the opponents. \nSo in time the opponents will have to declare bankruptcy. But on \nthe other hand over investment can lead to too stretched resources \nwith low income that will eventually drove the player to \nbankruptcy. To decide on these two we need a clear separation \ninto two groups of cases in the CBR database. The first group of \ncases will represent a situation on the board where the player has \nsignificant income per loop formed of one or more color group \nproperties, maybe railroads, some buildings on them and so on. It \nis important to note that in this case the player is better situated \nthan his opponents so he only needs to survive long enough to win \nthe game. In the other group of cases either the opponent is not \nwell positioned on the board or its opponents are better situated. \nIn this case further investments are necessary to improve the \nsituation so the player can have a chance of winning in the long \nrun.  \nThese metrics can be owning color groups, valuing groups of \nrailroads, evaluating the other opponents as well, and considering \nthe amount of cash. As it is obvious in monopoly the number of \nstreets is not as nearly as important as the combination of streets \nthe player owns. It is also important to note that one CBR case \ndoes not hold only a single strategy in place, but its solution can \nhave multiple different strategic goals. For example one CBR case \nmight simultaneously say buy this land to form a color group but \nalso trade some other unimportant property to increase cash \namount.  \nThe cases do not represent all possible combinations of board \npositions. They are only representation of typical game scenarios. \nThe CBR Case solutions do not give exact instructions in general \nbut rather strategic goals. For example one CBR Solution might \nsay trade the streets that you only have one of each for the ones \nthat you have two of that color already. Then the planner based on \nthe situation on the board needs to decompose this high level task \nto a low level operations. Like offer \"Mediterranean Avenue\" for \n\"Reading Railroad\" and offer $50. The exact amounts and actual \nstreets are left to the planer to evaluate.  \nThe monopoly CBR database is currently in development on \na monopoly clone game called Spaceopoly. The cases are \narchitected based on human player experience and knowledge. \nThere is a plan of making a number of slightly different strategies \nthat differ on the style of playing and then running simulation \ntests that would determine the particular validity of each database \nas well as validity of certain segments of the strategy or even \nparticular cases in the database.  \nThe actual execution of the strategies will not differ from \nstrategy to strategy since the plan execution is more related to the \nstructure and rules of the game than to the actual playing strategy. \n6.3 Details on the Planning Implementation \nFor the purpose of planning this implementation uses a \nmodification of the JSHOP2 planner. The Java Simple \nHierarchical Ordered Planner 2 is a domain independent HTN \nplanning system [15].  \nJSHOP2 uses ordered task decomposition in reducing the \nHTN to list of primitive tasks which form the plans. An ordered \ntask decomposition planner is an HTN planner that plans for tasks \nin the same order that they will be executed. This reduces the \ncomplexity of reasoning by removing a great deal of uncertainty \nabout the world, which makes it easy to incorporate substantial \nexpressive power into the planning algorithm. In addition to the \nusual HTN methods and operators, the planners can make use of \naxioms, can do mixed symbolic/numeric conditions, and can do \nexternal function calls. \n In order for the JSHOP2 planer to generate plans it needs \ntree crucial components: Domain, State and Tasks. The Domain \ndefines all the functionalities that the particular domain offers. \nThese are simple and complex tasks. The complex tasks also \ncalled methods create the hierarchy with the fact that they can be \nevaluated by simple tasks of other complex tasks. This is how a \nhierarchical structure of tasks is formed. The problem reduction is \ndone by reducing the high level complex tasks to simpler until all \nthe tasks are primitive. The list of primitive tasks forms the plan. \nThe State represents the state of the system. It is a simple \ndatabase of facts that represent the state of the system. The State \nis necessary to determine the way the problems or tasks are \nreduced to their primitive level. The reduction is done by \nsatisfying different prerequisites set in the methods; these \nprerequisites are defined in the state. The Tasks are high level \ntasks or methods defined in the Domain. The planner based on the \nState and the goals selects one or more high level tasks that need \nto be reduced to plans [Figure  15]. \nFigure 15: Diagram of a Planner \nThe plans then generate the game moves. The number of \nmoves generated by the plans is just a fraction of the possible \nmoves at that point. This reduces the game tree providing the \nopportunity to generate smaller and deeper game trees and making \nmore efficient decisions in general.  \n7. Conclusion \nEven though the results from the CBR database are not \ncomplete at this time partial strategies are implemented as cases \nand recognized during game play by the CBR system. These \nsmaller local strategies coupled with more global higher level \nstrategies that are particularly important at the beginning of the \ngame would form a complete CBR database and represent a \nknowledge engineered style of playing of the AI player.  \nThe AI Planning approach is a proven method by the tic-tac-\ntoe experiment and is suitable for implementing the strategies \nassociated with the CBR cases. \nThis approach in general benefits from both technologies, \nCBR as well as AI Planning and comprises an elegant solution. \nEven though AI Planning can be enough as a single technology \nfor some simpler problems like tic-tac-toe the complexity of \nMonopoly would mean that the Planner would have to incorporate \nCore Planner \nTasks\nPlan\nState\nInteractive and Adaptable Media\n301\n3rd International Conference on Digital Interactive Media in Entertainment and Arts\nlarge and complex domain and a very big state model. The CBR \napplication helps reduce this complexity by focusing the planning \non smaller domain of the game. Basically the CBR reduces the \noverall goal of the play (wining the game) to smaller more \nconcrete goals suitable to the particular state of the game, thus \nreducing the need for global planning strategies and complex \nplanning domain.  \nFurthermore this symbiosis of technologies gives way for \nmore precise and finely tuned strategies which can be difficult to \ninclude into global plan for the whole game. One simple example \nfor the Monopoly game would be this: Sometimes it\u2019s better to \nstay in jail because rolling double increases the probability of \nlanding on some field (two, four, six, eight, ten or twelve steps \nfrom the jail) that can be of great importance to the rest of the \ngame. These and similar small local strategies can be easily \nrecognized by similar cases in the CBR database.  \nIn other words the system is flexible enough so that new \nstrategies can be incorporated easily missing strategies can be also \nrecognized by the distance metrics as well as wrong assumptions \nin the strategies can be easily recognized. \nOne other important property of the system is that is highly \nconfigurable. The game its self can be diversely different \ndepending on the configuration of the board. Even though the \nplatform is restricted to Monopoly type of games, changing the \nlayout and values of the fields effectively brings completely \ndifferent properties of the game. In addition the CBR database \nrepresents the entire experience of the AI Player. It can be filled \nwith rich set of strategies or even configured with different flavors \nof difficulties of play, this of course coupled with the domain of \nthe planner which can differ from a case to a case as well.  \n8. Future Work \nFurther exploration of this technology would go towards \ncomplete implementation of an AI aware agent for monopoly. \nInitial results from the local cases with more specific strategies \nshow CBR as a capable tool for representing expertise in playing \nthe game. Completing the more general strategies and coupling \nthem with the planning domain will give precise results on the \nbenefits from this architecture. \nThere is also need for exploring the planning of strategies of \nopponents. This task is to some extent different because we \ncannot always expect the opponent to select the best move we \nthink. In the Tic-tac-toe example all possible moves of the \nopponent were taken into consideration, if we used the same \nplanner for the opponent only tie games would result from the \ngame tree. In other words mistakes of the players also need to be \nconsidered.  \nThe CBR Platform brings other functionalities well worth of \nexploring as well. The revision stage of the JColibri2 platform is \nbasically capable of fine tuning strategies or even developing new \nstrategies for the games. A well written underlying AI planning \nmodel with a capable feedback of the game tree evaluation back \nto the CBR revision capability can be an interesting concept in \nautomatic experience acquisition for the AI model. \nThere are also many other fields were combined CBR and \nplanning approach can be incorporated into a problem solution. \nThis combination is analogous in a big extent to a human way of \nreasoning. People in addition to logic of reasoning in situations \nwith lack of information rely to planning strategies and prior \nexperience, exactly the intuition behind CBR \u2013 AI Planning \narchitecture.  \n9.
